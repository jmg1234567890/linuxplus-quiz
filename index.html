The parameter net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 will accomplish the goal of setting up a new Linux server as a router. This parameter enables the IP forwarding feature, which allows the server to forward packets between different network interfaces. This is necessary for a router to route traffic between different networks. The parameter can be set in the /etc/sysctl.conf file or by using the sysctl command. This is the correct parameter to use to accomplish the goal. The other options are incorrect because they either do not exist (net.ipv4.ip_forwarding or net.ipv4.ip_route) or do not enable IP forwarding (net.ipv4.ip_forward=0).

    "question": "Some servers in an organization have been compromised. Users are unable to access to the organizations web page and other services. While reviewing the system log, a systems administrator notices messages from the kernel regarding firewall rules: Which of the following commands will remediate and help resolve the issue? A. The command iptables -F will remediate and help resolve the issue. The issue is caused by the firewall rules that block the access to the organizations web page and other services. The output of dmesg | grep firewall shows that the kernel has dropped packets from the source IP address 192.168.1.100 to the destination port 80, which is the default port for HTTP. The command iptables - F will flush all the firewall rules and allow the traffic to pass through. This command will resolve the issue and restore the access to the web page and other services. The other options are incorrect because they either do not affect the firewall rules (ip route flush or ip addr flush) or do not exist (iptables -R).

    "question": "An administrator started a long-running process in the foreground that needs to continue without interruption. Which of the following keystrokes should the administrator use to continue running the process in the background? A long-running process is a program that takes a long time to complete or runs indefinitely on a Linux system. A foreground process is a process that runs in the current terminal and receives input from the keyboard and output to the screen. A background process is a process that runs in the background and does not interact with the terminal. A background process can continue running even if the terminal is closed or disconnected. To start a long-running process in the background, the user can append an ampersand (&) to the command, such as someapp &. This will run someapp in the background and return control to the terminal immediately. To move a long-running process from the foreground to the background, the user can use two keystrokes: Ctrl+Z and bg. The Ctrl+Z keystroke will suspend (pause) the foreground process and return control to the terminal. The bg keystroke will resume (continue) the suspended process in the background and detach it from the terminal. The statement B is correct. The statements A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not perform the desired task. The bg keystroke alone will not work unless there is a suspended process to resume. The Ctrl+B keystroke will not suspend the foreground process, but rather move one character backward in some applications. The jobs keystroke will list all processes associated with the current terminal. The bg & keystroke will cause an error because bg does not take any arguments.

    "question": "Which of the following would significantly help to reduce data loss if more than one drive fails at the same time? RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks, which is a technology that combines multiple physical disks into a logical unit that provides improved performance, reliability, or both. RAID can significantly help to reduce data loss if more than one drive fails at the same time, depending on the RAID level used. For example, RAID 1 (mirroring) duplicates the data on two or more disks, so that if one disk fails, the data can be recovered from another disk. RAID 5 (striping with parity) distributes the data and parity information across three or more disks, so that if one disk fails, the data can be reconstructed from the remaining disks. RAID 6 (striping with double parity) extends RAID 5 by adding another parity block, so that if two disks fail, the data can still be recovered from the remaining disks. Reference: [What is RAID?]",

    "question": "A systems administrator is investigating a service that is not starting up. Given the following information: Which of the following systemd commands should the administrator use in order to obtain more details about the failing service? The systemd is a system and service manager for Linux systems that provides a standard way to control and monitor system services. The systemd uses various commands and tools to manage and troubleshoot system services, such as systemct1, sysctl, and journalctl. The systemct1 command is used to start, stop, enable, disable, restart, reload, status, and list system services. The sysctl command is used to configure kernel parameters at runtime. The journalctl command is used to view and filter the logs of system services. To investigate a service that is not starting up, the administrator can use the journalctl command with the -xu option. The -x option enables verbose output that includes explanatory text and priority information. The -u option filters the output by a specific unit name, such as network.service. Therefore, the command journalctl -xu network will show detailed logs of the network service, which can help identify the cause of the failure. The statement D is correct. The statements A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not provide more details about the failing service. The systemct1 analyze network command does not exist. The systemct1 info network command shows basic information about the network unit, such as description, load state, active state, sub state, and main PID. The sysctl -a network command shows all kernel parameters related to network settings. Reference: [How to Use Systemd to Manage System Services]",

    "question": "A systems administrator is adding a Linux-based server and removing a Windows-based server from a cloud-based environment. The changes need to be validated before they are applied to the cloudbased environment. Which of the following tools should be used to meet this requirement? Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and managing infrastructure as code in a cloud-based environment. Terraform uses configuration files to describe the desired state of the infrastructure and applies changes accordingly. Terraform supports various cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and more. To validate changes before they are applied to the cloud-based environment, the administrator can use the terraform plan command. This command will compare the current state of the infrastructure with the desired state defined in the configuration files and show what actions will be performed to achieve the desired state. This command will not make any changes to the infrastructure but only show a plan of changes. The statement D is correct. The statements A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not validate changes before they are applied to the cloud-based environment. Ansible is another tool for automating infrastructure management, but it does not have a plan command. Git clone and git pull are commands for working with git repositories, which are used for version control of code. Reference: [How to Use Terraform to Manage Cloud Infrastructure]",

To give the support group access to modify the config file while preserving the current ownership, the administrator can execute the command chmod 664 config \u00c2\u00a9. This will change the permissions of the config file to read and write for the owner and group, and read only for others. The owner and group of the file will remain as root and app respectively.

Upon further investigation, the administrator obtains the following output from one of the affected systems: Which of the following best explains the reported issue? Based on the output from one of the affected systems, the best explanation for the reported issue is that the virtual machine is running out of CPU resources, leading to users experiencing longer response times (D). The output shows that the system use percentage is very high (57.85%), indicating that the virtual machine is using most of its CPU cycles for system processes. This leaves little CPU time for user processes, which results in slower performance. The other explanations are not supported by the output or are contradictory.

The docker command is used to manage Docker containers, images, networks, volumes, and other resources on a Linux system. Docker is a platform that allows users to run applications in isolated environments called containers. Docker also provides networking features that allow users to create and manage networks for containers. To delete all unused networks that are not referenced by any container, the cloud engineer can use the docker network prune command. This command will remove all networks that have no containers connected to them. The statement C is correct. The statements A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not delete all unused networks.

The firewall-cmd command is used to manage firewalld, which is a firewall service for Linux systems that provides dynamic and persistent configuration of firewall rules. Firewalld uses zones and services to define different levels of trust and access for network connections. To permit access temporarily to an application running on port 1234/TCP on a Linux server, the systems administrator can use the firewall-cmd --add-port=1234/tcp command. This command will add a rule to the default zone (usually public) that allows incoming traffic on port 1234/TCP. The rule will only be effective until the next reload or restart of firewalld. To make the rule permanent, the administrator can add the --permanent option to the command. The statement C is correct. The statements A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not permit access to port 1234/TCP. The firewall-cmd --new-service=1234/tcp command does not exist. The firewall-cmd --service=1234 - -protocol=tcp command does not work because 1234 is not a predefined service name in firewalld. The firewall-cmd --add-whitelist-uid=1234 command does not exist.

    "question": "The development team wants to prevent a file from being modified by all users in a Linux system, including the root account. Which of the following commands can be used to accomplish this objective? The chattr command is used to change file attributes on Linux systems that support extended attributes, such as ext2, ext3, ext4, btrfs, xfs, and others. File attributes are flags that modify the behavior of files and directories. To prevent a file from being modified by all users in a Linux system, including the root account, the development team can use the chattr +i /app/conf/file command. This command will set the immutable attribute (+i) on the file /app/conf/file, which means that the file cannot be deleted, renamed, linked, appended, or written to by any user or process. To remove the immutable attribute, the development team can use the chattr -i /app/conf/file command. The statement C is correct. The statements A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not prevent the file from being modified by all users. The chmod /app/conf/file command does not work because it requires an argument to specify the permissions to change. The setenforce /app/conf/file command does not work because it is used to change the SELinux mode, not file attributes.

Which of the following commands should the administrator use to satisfy both requirements? This command will create a local port forwarding, which means that connections from the SSH client are forwarded via the SSH server, then to a destination server. In this case, the destination server is the same as the SSH server (localhost), and the destination port is 80. The SSH client will listen on port 8080 on the local machine, and any connection to that port will be forwarded to port 80 on the server. This way, the administrator can securely access the web service running on port 80 on the server by using  on the local machine. The other options are incorrect because: ssh -R 8080:localhost:80 admin@server This command will create a remote port forwarding, which means that connections from the SSH server are forwarded via the SSH client, then to a destination server. In this case, the destination server is the same as the SSH client (localhost), and the destination port is 80. The SSH server will listen on port 8080 on the remote machine, and any connection to that port will be forwarded to port 80 on the client.
