It is commonly used for authentication and managing user information in enterprise environments. MFA (Multi-factor Authentication): A security process in which a user is required to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource, such as a website or application. These factors typically include something the user knows (password), something the user has (a mobile phone or token), and something the user is (fingerprint or other biometrics). SSO (Single Sign-On): A user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials. This reduces the need to remember multiple passwords and improves user convenience. PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module): A framework that allows system administrators to configure authentication methods for applications on Unix-like systems.

The OnCalendar directive is used in the timer definition to specify the schedule on which the timer should run. If the schedule is incorrect, the timer will not run as expected. For example, if the administrator wants the job to run every two hours, the OnCalendar directive in the timer definition should be set to *:0/2.

If the schedule is incorrect, the timer will not run as expected, regardless of the state of the system-daemon services.

By default, systemd timers are configured to use UTC time. If the administrator specified an incorrect OnCalendar schedule, the timer may not run as expected. To schedule a job to run every two hours, the correct OnCalendar schedule should be \"0 */2 * * *\". This will run the job every two hours, starting at the top of the hour (i.e., at 0 minutes past the hour). If the administrator did not specify the correct OnCalendar schedule, the timer may be set to run daily or at some other incorrect interval, which would explain the behavior observed in the log file. upvoted 4 times Nvoid2 years, 7 months ago Selected Answer: C Picking C Here. upvoted 4 times SaadiaS2 years, 7 months ago *:0/2 The task will be executed every two minutes starting from the minute 0 https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-schedule-tasks-with-systemd-timers-in-linux upvoted 1 times SaadiaS2 years, 7 months ago Selected answer C upvoted 2 times ryanzou2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C I prefer C upvoted 4 times bjornborg2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C OnCalendar setting is wrong.

A file within a directory with a sticky bit set cannot be deleted by a user who does not have write permissions to the directory, regardless of the permissions on the file itself.

The \"echo \"umask 377\" >> /home/web/.bashrc\" command will satisfy the requirement by adding the umask setting to the user's.bashrc file. The umask setting determines the default file permissions for newly created files and directories. The value of 377 sets the default permissions to read-only for the owner of the file. The umask is specified in octal notation, and each digit represents the permissions for a different category of users. In this case, the first digit represents the permissions for the owner of the file, the second digit represents the permissions for the group owner of the file, and the third digit represents the permissions for others. A value of 3 means that the owner has read and write permissions, and a value of 7 means that the owner has read, write, and execute permissions.

The systemctl disable nginx command disables the nginx service so that it will not start automatically when the system boots up. However, the service can still be manually started if needed. The systemctl mask nginx command masks the nginx service, which means that it cannot be started, either automatically or manually. This is a more secure option compared to systemctl disable nginx, as it completely prevents the service from being started.

However, a disabled service can be loaded, and will be started if a service that depends on it is started; enable and disable only configure auto-start behaviour for units, and the state is easily overridden. A masked service is one whose unit file is a symlink to /dev/null. This makes it \"impossible\" to load the service, even if it is required by another, enabled service. When you mask a service, a symlink is created from /etc/systemd/system to /dev/null, leaving the original unit file elsewhere untouched. When you unmask a service the symlink is deleted. upvoted 1 times Alizadeh10 months, 2 weeks ago Selected Answer: C The correct answer is C. systemctl mask nginx. upvoted 1 times BreakOff8741 year, 3 months ago Selected Answer: C systemctl mask will prevent the service from being automatically started by other services. upvoted 2 times KnifeClown11 year, 4 months ago"},{"id":"PDF29","domain":"From PDFs","difficulty":2,"type":"single","stem":"A systems administrator has been tasked with disabling the nginx service from the environment to prevent it from being automatically and manually started.

(A) There is no \"device-id.\" (B) The 'fsck' command repairs file systems. (D) The 'blkid' command shows block device attributes. (The sane choice is UUID because the UUID is embedded in the file system of the block device, but that's not an option to choose.) upvoted 2 times DRVision1 year, 7 months ago Selected Answer: D Option D, mount disk by-blkid, is generally better than option C, mount disk by-label, for a few reasons: Uniqueness: The block ID (blkid) is a unique identifier for each block device, which is guaranteed to be the same across reboots and even if the disk is moved to a different machine. On the other hand, disk labels are not guaranteed to be unique and can be changed by the user, leading to potential conflicts. Presence: Not all filesystems support labels, and even when they do, labels are not always set by default. This means that you might not be able to mount a disk by label if the label has not been set. In contrast, all block devices have a blkid. Consistency: The blkid remains consistent even if the device name (e.g., /dev/sda, /dev/sdb) changes due to hardware changes or reconfiguration. Disk labels do not have this issue, but combined with the points above, using blkid is generally more reliable. Therefore, while both methods can be used to mount a disk, using the blkid (option D) is typically more reliable and less prone to errors or conflicts. upvoted 2 times e4181371 year, 5 months ago There is no block id. upvoted 1 times DRVision1 year, 7 months ago When a server is cloned, the filesystem labels (mount disk by-label) are also cloned. This means that if both the original and cloned servers are on the same network, there could be two disks with the same label, leading to confusion and potential errors. On the other hand, the block ID (blkid) is unique for each block device, even across clones. This means that even if a disk is cloned, the clone will have a different blkid. Therefore, mounting by blkid avoids the potential conflicts that can arise when cloning servers. So, even in the case of server cloning, using the blkid (option D) is typically more reliable and less prone to errors or conflicts. It ensures that the correct disk is mounted, regardless of any changes in the hardware configuration or cloning of disks. upvoted 1 times e4181371 year, 5 months ago There is no block id. upvoted 1 times wait4thebus1 year, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C See comment below.

Since the UUIDs of the source of the clone are unique to just that source device and mean nothing to anything else, it would make sense to use the more generic mount disk by-label method. So, C would be the answer. upvoted 2 times linux_admin2 years, 5 months ago Selected Answer: D The \"mount disk by-blkid\" option allows the administrator to mount the disk using a unique identifier (the block ID) instead of the device name. This is particularly useful when cloning a server and the device names have changed, as it helps to ensure that the correct disk is being mounted. The \"mount disk by device-id\" option is not correct because it does not exist in the standard Linux mount command. The \"fsck -A\" option is used to check and repair file systems, but it does not mount the disk. The \"mount disk by-label\" option is also incorrect as it mounts the disk based on the disk label, but if the disk label has changed as a result of the clone, this option will not work. upvoted 1 times linux_admin2 years, 5 months ago ***Discard*** upvoted 2 times e4181371 year, 5 months ago There is no block id. upvoted 1 times lo_01234_ol2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C Here ya' go: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/644708/how-can-i-prevent-disk-uuid-mismatch-when-cloning-a-machine upvoted 3 times Nvoid2 years, 8 months ago Device label better, i'm actually going to have to do this once i start my job doing this. lol upvoted 2 times Nvoid2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: A I changed by vote to A - Device ID is better, Ref: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en- us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_file_systems/assembly_overview-of-persistent-naming-attributes_managing-file-systems upvoted 1 times TheRealManish2 years, 8 months ago I don't know man, your link talks about UUID. selection A is referring to \"device-id\" which is not in your link, and doesnt really show up on google as anything meaningful in regards to linux. upvoted 1 times TheRealManish2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C According to this link the answer should be C: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/644708/how-can-i-prevent-disk-uuid-mismatch-when- cloning-a-machine upvoted 4 times TheRealManish2 years, 8 months ago not feeling super confident here, does anyone else have thoughts? upvoted 1 times Nvoid2 years, 8 months ago blkid is a command, i'm choosing C, i remember from the class i took Label is more reliable and easier to work with. upvoted 2 times linux_adminHighly Voted 11 months, 3 weeks ago B. lscpu The lscpu command is used to display information about the CPU architecture and the system topology on Linux systems.

This means even if a user has write permission to the directory, they cannot delete or rename files owned by others. Setgid and Permissions: Option C sets the setgid bit and gives the group read, write, and execute permissions. The setgid bit causes new files and directories created in the directory to inherit the group ownership of the directory, but it does not prevent file deletion or modification by non-owners. The permissions 770 give the owner and the group full permissions (read, write, execute), but they do not prevent file deletion or modification by non- owners who are in the group.

The message specifically mentions \"out of memory\", which suggests that the root cause of the issue is related to memory, not semaphores. upvoted 2 times KnifeClown11 year, 11 months ago Selected Answer: A The message in /var/log/messages is indicating that the process mysqld is using too many semaphores, which is causing the connection issue. So the correct answer is A: The process mysqld is using too many semaphores. Semaphores are used to control access to shared resources in a system. When a process requires access to a shared resource, it acquires a semaphore. When the process has finished using the resource, it releases the semaphore. If a process requires too many semaphores, it can cause other processes to block, leading to performance issues. In this case, the mysqld process is using too many semaphores, causing connections to the MariaDB service to be closed unexpectedly. It's important to note that other factors such as memory, disk space, CPU usage, etc. should also be monitored to determine the root cause of the issue. upvoted 1 times KnifeClown11 year, 11 months ago Correct answer C: upvoted 1 times TheRealManish2 years, 2 months ago Selected Answer: C Maybe I'm wrong, but semaphore is just a non-negative shared variable?

However, the directory must already exist and have the proper permissions set.

This command consists of three parts: persistent: the search pattern to look for in the file /: a delimiter that separates the search pattern from the replacement pattern ^#//q: the replacement pattern and a command to quit after the first match is found. The ^# means \"replace the first occurrence of a comment symbol at the beginning of the line with nothing,\" and the q means \"quit immediately after the replacement is made.\" Note that the persistent search pattern and the # comment symbol are separated by a caret (^) character, which is a regular expression metacharacter that matches the start of a line. upvoted 2 times KnifeClown11 year, 10 months ago Selected Answer: C C for real upvoted 2 times KnifeClown11 year, 10 months ago C. sed -i 's/auto/persistent/g' /etc/systemd/journald.conf && sed -i 'persistent/s/ˆ#//q' /etc/systemd/journald.conf upvoted 2 times Pinnubhai1 year, 11 months ago Selected Answer: C Replace storage type with Storage=persistent # sed -i 's/#Storage.*/Storage=persistent/' /etc/systemd/journald.conf Next you can restart systemd-journald service # systemctl restart systemd-journald.service upvoted 1 times Ckl222 years ago Selected Answer: C C does appear to be the only one that would make the logs persistent upvoted 1 times MissAllen2 years, 1 month ago I don't see any correct answer, but C is the closest. A is not correct because command one searches for the pattern \"auto\" in the file /etc/systemd/journald.conf, ignoring case. It will find it, thereby causing command two to execute. Restarting the journald service doesn't help if you made no changes to the.conf file!. Answer C searches for the pattern \"auto\", globally in the same file, but replaces it with the pattern \"persistent\", in the file (that is the -i option). That's great, but I tested it with command two and get an error. I suggest command two be the restart of the journald service. upvoted 4 times Nvoid2 years, 1 month ago Good work MissAllen, (C) seems correct 1st command & (A) 2nd Command.

The 0.0.0.0:* field in the output indicates that the application is listening on all available network interfaces, but the IP address 0.0.0.0 does not actually represent a valid IP address.

The CPU is overloaded. The load average of 9.90 indicates that there are, on average, 9.90 processes in the running or runnable state. Given that there is only a single CPU, this means that there are far more processes needing CPU time than the CPU can handle, leading to an overloaded CPU. This is likely the cause of the slowness. The other options (A, C, and D) do not seem to be supported by the provided output. The output does not indicate that the system is running out of swap space (almost all free), that the memory is exhausted (still have a lot of free mem), or that the processes are paging (only 5 for pages used).

The significant ( >1000 KB/s) si (swap in from disk ) and so (swap out to disk) values indicate that the system is actively PAGING data between RAM and swap space, which significantly slows down performance due to the slow nature of disk I/O compared to RAM access. High values (>0 consistently) in the b column (blocked [aka waiting] PROCESSES) also support the indication of I/O bottlenecks related to PAGING. Heavy PAGING indicates that PROCESSES are waiting for data to be read from or written to swap space, which causes the observed I/O bottleneck and system slowness.

Using the systemctl reload sshd command will cause the SSH service to reload its configuration file and apply any changes that have been made, without requiring the service to be stopped and restarted. This is the preferred method of applying changes to the SSH configuration file because it allows changes to be made without affecting any currently connected users. If the systemctl reload sshd command is not available, the systemctl restart sshd command can be used instead.

The ip command is used to show or manipulate the network interfaces on a Linux system. The link option is used to display or modify the attributes of a network device, and the show option is used to display the specified device. To check the link status of eth1, the following command can be used: ip link show eth1 This command will display information about the eth1 network interface, including its status and any configured options. upvoted 1 times KnifeClown11 year, 5 months ago Selected Answer: D The command \"ip link show eth1\" is the correct command to check the link status of the network interface named eth1 in a Linux server. The \"ip\" command is part of the iproute2 suite of networking tools, which provides a more advanced and flexible way of managing network interfaces compared to the traditional ifconfig command. The \"link\" subcommand of \"ip\" can be used to show information about network interfaces, including the link status. By adding the interface name (eth1), the command will only show information about the specified interface. The \"ip link show eth1\" command will display information about the eth1 interface, including the current status of the link, the speed and duplex of the connection, and the MTU (maximum transmission unit) of the interface.

It provides a summary of available and used space in a volume group but does not list out the individual logical volumes within that group. On the other hand, the lvs command lists all logical volumes in all volume groups if no arguments are given, or all logical volumes in the specified volume group. This makes lvs the correct command to use when you want to see a list of all volumes that are part of a specific volume group.

Option B (grep -nv denied) would print the name of the file and the line number of all the lines that do not contain \"denied\", which is not what is required.

The output from the find command is then passed to xargs, which is used to execute the grep command on each file. The grep command is used to search for occurrences of the word \"denied\".

The system is under CPU pressure and will require additional vCPUs. The load average (4.22 6.63 5.58) indicates that the system is under CPU pressure. The load average is the average number of tasks waiting for CPU time over a given time interval. If the load average is consistently high, it can mean that the system is struggling to keep up with demand and that more CPU resources are needed. In this case, the administrator may need to consider adding additional vCPUs to alleviate the CPU pressure. upvoted 1 times Nvoid2 years, 7 months ago Selected Answer: B real world, anyone would first reboot, and if it happened again frequently then upgrade.

Uptime is simply a measure of the time the system has been running without any downtime. It is possible for a system to run for much longer without requiring a reboot. Reboots are typically required to install updates or address specific performance or stability issues, but simply having a long uptime does not automatically imply a need for a reboot. upvoted 1 times imnewtothis9 months, 3 weeks ago Selected Answer: D This command adds a rule to the firewall using firewall-cmd, allowing UDP traffic on port 53, which is used for DNS communication.

Explanation: Application Control is a security feature in network security appliances that is used to identify and control the applications that are allowed to access the network. The feature allows administrators to create policies that specify which applications are allowed to access the network and what actions are allowed for each application. The main objective of Application Control is to ensure the security and privacy of information by controlling the applications that are allowed to access the network. This helps to prevent unauthorized access, data leakage, and other security risks that may arise from the use of unapproved applications. By enforcing policies on allowed applications, administrators can ensure that sensitive information remains secure and confidential. Therefore, the correct answer is: D.

The command calls the nano text editor, which lets the user edit the file directly in the terminal. When the file opens, the user scrolls to the end of the text and adds the following setting. \"vm.swappiness=0\" >> append /etc/sysctl.conf && sysctl -p sysctl -p ( ( allows you to load the settings from a configuration file ) upvoted 2 times Damon5411 months, 1 week ago Linux swappiness is a kernel parameter that determines how aggressively the Linux virtual machine (VM) swaps pages between memory and the swap space on the system's disk. Users can fine-tune the rate at which a Linux kernel can move pages into and out of active memory using the swappable parameter, which can be set between 0 and 200. The higher the number, the more aggressively the VM swaps data to disk. By default, the swappiness value on most Linux computers is set to 60. The user can change this level to a different setting either temporarily or indefinitely. Some database servers managed cache to use RAM, and is capable of managing what should be in RAM and what shouldn’t be. Allowing the Linux operating system to have too much control over what memory pages are in RAM is likely to lower your database performance.

The loopback interface has the IP address 127.0.0.1, which is a lso known as localhost. The netstat output shows that the application is listening on port 9443 usi ng the IP address 127.0.0.1. This means that the application can only accept connections from the same system, not from other systems on the network. This can prevent the users from reaching the appli cation and cause the issue. The administrator should configure the application to listen on the IP address 0.0.0.0, which means all available interfaces, or on the s pecific IP address of the syst em that is reachable from the network. This will allow the application to accept connections from othe r systems and resolve the issue. The cause of the issue is that the application is listening on the loopback interface. This is the correct answer to the question. The other options are incorrect because they are not supported by the outputs. The IP address 0.0.0.0 is valid and means all interfac es, the application is not listening on port 1234, and the application is running as shown by the proce ss ID 1234.

Password-based authentication requires the user to enter the pa ssword of the remote system every time they connect. Key-based authentication requires the user to generate a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is stored on the remote system, while the private key is kept on the local system. The public key and the private key are mathematically related, but not identical. The SSH protocol use s the keys to verify the identity of the user and establish a secure connection without requiring a password.

Docker is a software platform that allows the administrator to create, run, and manage containers on Linux systems. Containers are isolated and lightweight environments that can run applications and services without affecting the host system.

The inod es is at full capacity and would affect file creation for users. An inode is a data structure tha t stores information about a fi le or directory, such as its name, size, permissions, owner, timestamps, and location on the disk. Each file or directory has a unique inode number that identifies it.

DNS servers are responsible for translating hostn ames into IP addresses, and vi ce versa. If the application server has incorrect or unreachable DNS servers configured, it will not be able to resolve the hostname of the database server and communicate with it. To troubleshoot this issue, the systems engineer should check the DNS configuration on the application server, which is usually stored in the /etc/resolv.conf file.

The FACL consists of two parts: the access ACL and the default ACL. The access ACL applies to the current object, while the default ACL applies to the objects cr eated within the directory2. The access ACL has three entrie s: user, group, and other. These are similar to the standard Linux permissions, but they can be specified for individual users or groups as well. The user entry shows that the owner of the directory (root) has read, write, and exe cute permissions (rwx). The group entry shows that the group owner of the directory (root) has re ad and execute permissions (r-x). The other entry shows that all other users have no permissions (”). The default ACL has five entries: user, group, group:wheel, mas k, and other. These are applied to any files or directories created within /compti a. The user entry shows that the owner of the new object will h ave read, write, and execute permissions (rwx). The group entry shows that the group owner o f the new object will have read and execute permissions (r-x). The group:wheel entry shows that the members of the wheel group will have read, write, and execute permissions (rwx) on the new object. The mask entry shows that the maximum permissions allowed for any user or group are read, wri te, and execute (rwx). The other entry shows that all other users will have no permissions (”) o n the new object. Therefore, based on the FACL out put, members of the wheel group can read files in /comptia, as they have read permission on both the directory and any files within it. Option B is incorrect because the sticky bit is not set on /comptia or any files within it. The s ticky bit is a special permission that prevents users from deleting or renaming files that they do not own in a shared directory3.

Option C is incorrect because other users cannot create files in /co mptia, as they have no permissi ons on the directory or any files within it.

User1 is allowed to use systemctl to start and stop the httpd service, while webadmin is allowed to use init.d, service, or apache2ctl to restart the httpd service. However, the user1 is unable to restart the service, only start and stop it. To fix this, user1 should be able to use the same commands as webadmin, whic h can be achieved by listing webadmin as a group in the custom.conf file, using the syntax % groupname. This way, user1 will inherit the sudo privileges of the webadmin group, and be able to restart the Apache web service without compromising the least privilege security model.

If the SSH server was not running on the remote server, the port would be shown as closed, which means that nmap received a TCP RST packet in response to its probe. If the remote SSH server was using SSH protocol version 1, the port would be shown as op en, which means that nmap received a TCP SYN/ACK packet in response to its probe. If the SSH host key on the remote server had expired, the port would also be shown as open, but the SSH clie nt would display a warning message about the host key verification failure. Therefore, the best ex planation for the filtered state of the port 22/tcp is that a firewall is preventing nmap from reaching the SSH server.

They do not consume any resources, but they occupy a slot in the process table. To remove them from the process list, the administrator needs to kill the parent process of the zombies, which will cause them to be reaped by the init process (PID 1). Killing the zombies themselves or the init process will not have any effect, as they are already dead.
