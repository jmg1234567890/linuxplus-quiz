It is commonly used for authentication and managing user information in enterprise environments. MFA (Multi-factor Authentication): A security process in which a user is required to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource, such as a website or application. These factors typically include something the user knows (password), something the user has (a mobile phone or token), and something the user is (fingerprint or other biometrics). SSO (Single Sign-On): A user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials. This reduces the need to remember multiple passwords and improves user convenience. PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module): A framework that allows system administrators to configure authentication methods for applications on Unix-like systems.

The OnCalendar directive is used in the timer definition to specify the schedule on which the timer should run. If the schedule is incorrect, the timer will not run as expected. For example, if the administrator wants the job to run every two hours, the OnCalendar directive in the timer definition should be set to *:0/2. To resolve the issue, the administrator should check the timer definition and make sure that the OnCalendar schedule is set correctly. After making the necessary changes, the administrator should reload the timer and service definitions and check the log file again to see if the job is running as expected. upvoted 4 times linux_admin2 years, 4 months ago In the previous question, the answer choice D was \"The system-daemon services need to be reloaded.\" This answer is not the most likely cause of the issue because reloading the system-daemon services will not fix an incorrect OnCalendar schedule in the timer definition. The OnCalendar directive is used in the timer definition to specify the schedule on which the timer should run. If the schedule is incorrect, the timer will not run as expected, regardless of the state of the system-daemon services. The most likely cause of the issue, as stated in answer choice C, is an incorrect OnCalendar schedule in the timer definition. To resolve the issue, the administrator should check the timer definition and make sure that the OnCalendar schedule is set correctly. upvoted 4 times KnifeClown12 years, 4 months ago Selected Answer: C When using systemd timers, the \"OnCalendar\" option is used to define when the job should run. By default, systemd timers are configured to use UTC time. If the administrator specified an incorrect OnCalendar schedule, the timer may not run as expected. To schedule a job to run every two hours, the correct OnCalendar schedule should be \"0 */2 * * *\". This will run the job every two hours, starting at the top of the hour (i.e., at 0 minutes past the hour). If the administrator did not specify the correct OnCalendar schedule, the timer may be set to run daily or at some other incorrect interval, which would explain the behavior observed in the log file. upvoted 4 times Nvoid2 years, 7 months ago Selected Answer: C Picking C Here. upvoted 4 times SaadiaS2 years, 7 months ago *:0/2 The task will be executed every two minutes starting from the minute 0 https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-schedule-tasks-with-systemd-timers-in-linux upvoted 1 times SaadiaS2 years, 7 months ago Selected answer C upvoted 2 times ryanzou2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C I prefer C upvoted 4 times bjornborg2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C OnCalendar setting is wrong.

The \"echo \"umask 377\" >> /home/web/.bashrc\" command will satisfy the requirement by adding the umask setting to the user's.bashrc file. The umask setting determines the default file permissions for newly created files and directories. The value of 377 sets the default permissions to read-only for the owner of the file.

However, a disabled service can be loaded, and will be started if a service that depends on it is started; enable and disable only configure auto-start behaviour for units, and the state is easily overridden. A masked service is one whose unit file is a symlink to /dev/null. This makes it \"impossible\" to load the service, even if it is required by another, enabled service. When you mask a service, a symlink is created from /etc/systemd/system to /dev/null, leaving the original unit file elsewhere untouched.

The other three numbers (744) represent the permissions for the owner, group, and others, respectively. In this case, the owner has read, write, and execute permissions (7), the group has read and execute permissions (4), and others have only read permission (4).

(A) There is no \"device-id.\" (B) The 'fsck' command repairs file systems. (D) The 'blkid' command shows block device attributes. (The sane choice is UUID because the UUID is embedded in the file system of the block device, but that's not an option to choose.) upvoted 2 times DRVision1 year, 7 months ago Selected Answer: D Option D, mount disk by-blkid, is generally better than option C, mount disk by-label, for a few reasons: Uniqueness: The block ID (blkid) is a unique identifier for each block device, which is guaranteed to be the same across reboots and even if the disk is moved to a different machine. On the other hand, disk labels are not guaranteed to be unique and can be changed by the user, leading to potential conflicts. Presence: Not all filesystems support labels, and even when they do, labels are not always set by default. This means that you might not be able to mount a disk by label if the label has not been set. In contrast, all block devices have a blkid. Consistency: The blkid remains consistent even if the device name (e.g., /dev/sda, /dev/sdb) changes due to hardware changes or reconfiguration. Disk labels do not have this issue, but combined with the points above, using blkid is generally more reliable. Therefore, while both methods can be used to mount a disk, using the blkid (option D) is typically more reliable and less prone to errors or conflicts. upvoted 2 times e4181371 year, 5 months ago There is no block id. upvoted 1 times DRVision1 year, 7 months ago When a server is cloned, the filesystem labels (mount disk by-label) are also cloned. This means that if both the original and cloned servers are on the same network, there could be two disks with the same label, leading to confusion and potential errors. On the other hand, the block ID (blkid) is unique for each block device, even across clones. This means that even if a disk is cloned, the clone will have a different blkid. Therefore, mounting by blkid avoids the potential conflicts that can arise when cloning servers. So, even in the case of server cloning, using the blkid (option D) is typically more reliable and less prone to errors or conflicts. It ensures that the correct disk is mounted, regardless of any changes in the hardware configuration or cloning of disks. upvoted 1 times e4181371 year, 5 months ago There is no block id. upvoted 1 times wait4thebus1 year, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C See comment below.

Since the UUIDs of the source of the clone are unique to just that source device and mean nothing to anything else, it would make sense to use the more generic mount disk by-label method. So, C would be the answer. upvoted 2 times linux_admin2 years, 5 months ago Selected Answer: D The \"mount disk by-blkid\" option allows the administrator to mount the disk using a unique identifier (the block ID) instead of the device name. This is particularly useful when cloning a server and the device names have changed, as it helps to ensure that the correct disk is being mounted. The \"mount disk by device-id\" option is not correct because it does not exist in the standard Linux mount command. The \"fsck -A\" option is used to check and repair file systems, but it does not mount the disk. The \"mount disk by-label\" option is also incorrect as it mounts the disk based on the disk label, but if the disk label has changed as a result of the clone, this option will not work. upvoted 1 times linux_admin2 years, 5 months ago ***Discard*** upvoted 2 times e4181371 year, 5 months ago There is no block id. upvoted 1 times lo_01234_ol2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C Here ya' go: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/644708/how-can-i-prevent-disk-uuid-mismatch-when-cloning-a-machine upvoted 3 times Nvoid2 years, 8 months ago Device label better, i'm actually going to have to do this once i start my job doing this. lol upvoted 2 times Nvoid2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: A I changed by vote to A - Device ID is better, Ref: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en- us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_file_systems/assembly_overview-of-persistent-naming-attributes_managing-file-systems upvoted 1 times TheRealManish2 years, 8 months ago I don't know man, your link talks about UUID. selection A is referring to \"device-id\" which is not in your link, and doesnt really show up on google as anything meaningful in regards to linux. upvoted 1 times TheRealManish2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C According to this link the answer should be C: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/644708/how-can-i-prevent-disk-uuid-mismatch-when- cloning-a-machine upvoted 4 times TheRealManish2 years, 8 months ago not feeling super confident here, does anyone else have thoughts? upvoted 1 times Nvoid2 years, 8 months ago blkid is a command, i'm choosing C, i remember from the class i took Label is more reliable and easier to work with. upvoted 2 times linux_adminHighly Voted 11 months, 3 weeks ago B. lscpu The lscpu command is used to display information about the CPU architecture and the system topology on Linux systems.

This option sets the setgid (chmod +2) and the permissions rwx (chmod 700) on the directory. This means that files created within the directory will inherit the group ownership of the directory, rather than the user's primary group, and members of the group will have full permissions to read, write, and execute files within the directory. Non-group members will not have access to the directory. This helps to ensure that files created within the directory can only be modified by members of the group and not by non-owners. upvoted 2 times tutita1 year, 8 months ago"},{"id":"PDF63","domain":"From PDFs","difficulty":2,"type":"single","stem":"A Linux administrator created the directory /project/access2all.

So the correct answer is A: The process mysqld is using too many semaphores. Semaphores are used to control access to shared resources in a system. When a process requires access to a shared resource, it acquires a semaphore. When the process has finished using the resource, it releases the semaphore. If a process requires too many semaphores, it can cause other processes to block, leading to performance issues. In this case, the mysqld process is using too many semaphores, causing connections to the MariaDB service to be closed unexpectedly.

This command consists of three parts: persistent: the search pattern to look for in the file /: a delimiter that separates the search pattern from the replacement pattern ^#//q: the replacement pattern and a command to quit after the first match is found. The ^# means \"replace the first occurrence of a comment symbol at the beginning of the line with nothing,\" and the q means \"quit immediately after the replacement is made.\" Note that the persistent search pattern and the # comment symbol are separated by a caret (^) character, which is a regular expression metacharacter that matches the start of a line. upvoted 2 times KnifeClown11 year, 10 months ago Selected Answer: C C for real upvoted 2 times KnifeClown11 year, 10 months ago C. sed -i 's/auto/persistent/g' /etc/systemd/journald.conf && sed -i 'persistent/s/ˆ#//q' /etc/systemd/journald.conf upvoted 2 times Pinnubhai1 year, 11 months ago Selected Answer: C Replace storage type with Storage=persistent # sed -i 's/#Storage.*/Storage=persistent/' /etc/systemd/journald.conf Next you can restart systemd-journald service # systemctl restart systemd-journald.service upvoted 1 times Ckl222 years ago Selected Answer: C C does appear to be the only one that would make the logs persistent upvoted 1 times MissAllen2 years, 1 month ago I don't see any correct answer, but C is the closest.

Restarting the journald service doesn't help if you made no changes to the.conf file!. Answer C searches for the pattern \"auto\", globally in the same file, but replaces it with the pattern \"persistent\", in the file (that is the -i option).

The CPU is overloaded. The load average of 9.90 indicates that there are, on average, 9.90 processes in the running or runnable state. Given that there is only a single CPU, this means that there are far more processes needing CPU time than the CPU can handle, leading to an overloaded CPU. This is likely the cause of the slowness. The other options (A, C, and D) do not seem to be supported by the provided output. The output does not indicate that the system is running out of swap space (almost all free), that the memory is exhausted (still have a lot of free mem), or that the processes are paging (only 5 for pages used).

High values (>0 consistently) in the b column (blocked [aka waiting] PROCESSES) also support the indication of I/O bottlenecks related to PAGING.

If the systemctl reload sshd command is not available, the systemctl restart sshd command can be used instead.

Before pushing the changes to the remote repository, the administrator should first ensure that the changes are committed to the local repository using the \"commit\" command. The administrator should also ensure that the local repository is up-to-date with the remote repository by using the \"pull\" command to download any changes made by others before attempting to push the changes.

This makes lvs the correct command to use when you want to see a list of all volumes that are part of a specific volume group.

This command will remove all containers, including those that are running, stopped, and exited. docker rm --state exited, on the other hand, only removes containers in an exited state. The --state option is used to specify the state of the containers to be removed, and exited is the state that we want to remove. This command is useful for cleaning up containers that have exited and are no longer needed, freeing up resources and disk space occupied by these containers.

Option A (grep -ln denied) would print the name of the file and the line number of the occurrence of \"denied\", but it doesn't meet the requirement of including both uppercase and lowercase occurrences. Option B (grep -nv denied) would print the name of the file and the line number of all the lines that do not contain \"denied\", which is not what is required.

The output from the find command is then passed to xargs, which is used to execute the grep command on each file. The grep command is used to search for occurrences of the word \"denied\". The -l option causes grep to print only the names of the files that contain a match, and the -i option causes grep to perform a case-insensitive search, so that both uppercase and lowercase occurrences of the word \"denied\" will be matched. upvoted 1 times Nvoid1 year, 7 months ago Selected Answer: D need the -i for ignore case going with `D` !! upvoted 4 times Nvoid1 year, 7 months ago btw its xargs not xrags, mod please fix."},{"id":"PDF135","domain":"From PDFs","difficulty":2,"type":"single","stem":"A Linux administrator reviews a set of log output files and needs to identify files that contain any occurrence of the word denied.

Uptime is simply a measure of the time the system has been running without any downtime. It is possible for a system to run for much longer without requiring a reboot.

We can see that there is a local DNS entry mapping portal.comptia.org -> 10.10.10.55. But, the actual DNS resolution, from the `host` command, is different, portal.comptia.org -> 192.168.1.55. Something is taking priority over the local DNS in /etc/hosts. If we delete the entry in /etc/hosts, I doubt it will resolve our connection problem, because the system is getting its DNS resolution from something else, possibly a cache. I think we should flush the local DNS cache and try again. We should also verify what is the correct IP it should resolve to. Perhaps we SHOULD also remove the entry from /etc/hosts, but for the reason that the private DNS server (at 10.10.10.5) should be responsible for resolving DNS, not workstations. upvoted 3 times BlackSkullz10 months, 1 week ago Selected Answer: AD When a service is masked, it cannot start on boot or be started manually.

The default route is the route that is used when no other route matches the destination of a packet. The default route is usually the gateway that connects the local network to the Internet. The server configuration shows that there are two default routes in the routing table, one with the gateway 192.168.1.1 and the other with the gateway 10.0.0.1. This can cause a conflict and confusion for the server when deciding which gateway to use for the outgoing packets. Some pa ckets may be sent to the wrong gateway and fail to reach the Internet, while some packets may be sent to the correct gateway and work as intended. This can result in intermittent connection is sues and inconsistent behavior. The administrator should remove one of the default routes and keep only the correct one for the network.

The LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a tool for managing disk sp ace on Linux systems. The LVM allows the administrator to create logical volumes that span ac ross multiple physical volumes, such as hard disks or partitions. The LVM also supports different ty pes of logical volumes, such as linear, striped, or mirrored. A mirrored logical volume is a type of lo gical volume that creates a copy of the data on another physical volume, providing redundancy and fault tolerance.

Application Control can also prevent malware, untrusted, or unwanted applications from running on th e network, reducing the risks and costs associated with data breaches1. Application Control can also improve the overall network stability and performance by eliminating unnecessary or harmful applications1. Application Control is not mainly used to filter out specific c ontent, although it can be combined with other technologies such as URL f iltering or content filtering t o achieve that goal.

This can be inferred from the output of the top command, which shows the percentage of CPU ti me spent in different states. The wa state stands for wait, and it indicates that the CPU is idle while waiting for an I/O operation to complete. In this case, the wa state is 52.4%, which means that more than half of the CPU time is wasted on waiting for data inputs. This can cause a high I/O la tency and affect the performance of the server.

The inod es is at full capacity and would affect file creation for users. An inode is a data structure tha t stores information about a fi le or directory, such as its name, size, permissions, owner, timestamps, and location on the disk. Each file or directory has a unique inode number that identifies it. The number of inodes on a filesystem is fixed when the filesystem is created, and it determines how many files and directories can b e created on that filesystem. If the inodes are exhausted, no new files or directories can be create d, even if there is enough disk space available. The output for the second command shows that the /ftpusers/ fil esystem has 0% of inodes available, which means that all the inodes have been used up. This would p revent users from creating new files on the FTP server. The administrator should either delete some unused files or directories to free up some inodes, or resize the filesystem to increase the number of inodes. The other options are incorrect because: A) The users do not have the correct permissions to create file s on the FTP server.

DNS servers are responsible for translating hostn ames into IP addresses, and vi ce versa. If the application server has incorrect or unreachable DNS servers configured, it will not be able to resolve the hostname of the database server and communicate with it. To troubleshoot this issue, the systems engineer should check the DNS configuration on the application server, which is usually stored in the /etc/resolv.conf file.

D. Only root can create files in /comptia."],"answer":[0],"explanation":"Explanation: The output shows the file access control list (FACL) of the /co mptia directory, which is an extension of the standard Linux permissions that allows more fine-grained co ntrol over file and directory access1. The FACL consists of two parts: the access ACL and the default ACL. The access ACL applies to the current object, while the default ACL applies to the objects cr eated within the directory2. The access ACL has three entrie s: user, group, and other. These are similar to the standard Linux permissions, but they can be specified for individual users or groups as well. The user entry shows that the owner of the directory (root) has read, write, and exe cute permissions (rwx). The group entry shows that the group owner of the directory (root) has re ad and execute permissions (r-x). The other entry shows that all other users have no permissions (”). The default ACL has five entries: user, group, group:wheel, mas k, and other. These are applied to any files or directories created within /compti a. The user entry shows that the owner of the new object will h ave read, write, and execute permissions (rwx). The group entry shows that the group owner o f the new object will have read and execute permissions (r-x). The group:wheel entry shows that the members of the wheel group will have read, write, and execute permissions (rwx) on the new object. The mask entry shows that the maximum permissions allowed for any user or group are read, wri te, and execute (rwx). The other entry shows that all other users will have no permissions (”) o n the new object. Therefore, based on the FACL out put, members of the wheel group can read files in /comptia, as they have read permission on both the directory and any files within it. Option B is incorrect because the sticky bit is not set on /comptia or any files within it. The s ticky bit is a special permission that prevents users from deleting or renaming files that they do not own in a shared directory3. It is symbolized by a t character in th e execute position of others. Option C is incorrect because other users cannot create files in /co mptia, as they have no permissi ons on the directory or any files within it. Option D is incorrect because root is not the only user who can create files in /comptia. Any user who has write permission on the directory can create files within it, such as members of the wheel group.","outputs":["<exhibit restored> This item expected an exhibit/output."]},{"id":"PDF566","domain":"From PDFs","difficulty":2,"type":"single","stem":"After connecting to a remote host via SSH, an administrator attempts to run an application but receives the following error: [user@workstation ~]$ ssh admin@srv1 Last login: Tue Mar 29 18:03:34 2022 [admin@srvl ~] $ /usr/local/bin/config_manager Error: cannot open display: [admin@srv1 ~] $ Which of the following should the administrator do to resolve t his error?","choices":["Disconnect from the SSH sessio n and reconnect using the ssh -x command.","Add Options X11 to the /home/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys file.","Open port 6000 on the workstation and restart the firewalld service.","Enable X11 forwarding in /etc/ssh/ssh_config and restart the server."],"answer":[0],"explanation":"Explanation: The error indicates that the application requires an X11 displa y, but the SSH session does not forward the X11 connection.

If the SSH server was not running on the remote server, the port would be shown as closed, which means that nmap received a TCP RST packet in response to its probe.

By default, systemd timers are configured to use UTC time. If the administrator specified an incorrect OnCalendar schedule, the timer may not run as expected. To schedule a job to run every two hours, the correct OnCalendar schedule should be \"0 */2 * * *\". This will run the job every two hours, starting at the top of the hour (i.e., at 0 minutes past the hour).

The \"echo \"umask 377\" >> /home/web/.bashrc\" command will satisfy the requirement by adding the umask setting to the user's.bashrc file. The umask setting determines the default file permissions for newly created files and directories. The value of 377 sets the default permissions to read-only for the owner of the file. The umask is specified in octal notation, and each digit represents the permissions for a different category of users. In this case, the first digit represents the permissions for the owner of the file, the second digit represents the permissions for the group owner of the file, and the third digit represents the permissions for others. A value of 3 means that the owner has read and write permissions, and a value of 7 means that the owner has read, write, and execute permissions.

However, a disabled service can be loaded, and will be started if a service that depends on it is started; enable and disable only configure auto-start behaviour for units, and the state is easily overridden. A masked service is one whose unit file is a symlink to /dev/null. This makes it \"impossible\" to load the service, even if it is required by another, enabled service. When you mask a service, a symlink is created from /etc/systemd/system to /dev/null, leaving the original unit file elsewhere untouched.

The \"4744\" options specify the access rights in binary form. The first number (4) represents the setuid (SUID) bit, which causes the file to run with the effective user ID of the owner of the file, rather than with the effective user ID of the user who is running it. The other three numbers (744) represent the permissions for the owner, group, and others, respectively. In this case, the owner has read, write, and execute permissions (7), the group has read and execute permissions (4), and others have only read permission (4). So, the command \"chmod 4744 dev_team.txt\" sets the SUID bit and the access rights to 744 for the file dev_team.txt.

(The sane choice is UUID because the UUID is embedded in the file system of the block device, but that's not an option to choose.) upvoted 2 times DRVision1 year, 7 months ago Selected Answer: D Option D, mount disk by-blkid, is generally better than option C, mount disk by-label, for a few reasons: Uniqueness: The block ID (blkid) is a unique identifier for each block device, which is guaranteed to be the same across reboots and even if the disk is moved to a different machine. On the other hand, disk labels are not guaranteed to be unique and can be changed by the user, leading to potential conflicts. Presence: Not all filesystems support labels, and even when they do, labels are not always set by default. This means that you might not be able to mount a disk by label if the label has not been set. In contrast, all block devices have a blkid. Consistency: The blkid remains consistent even if the device name (e.g., /dev/sda, /dev/sdb) changes due to hardware changes or reconfiguration. Disk labels do not have this issue, but combined with the points above, using blkid is generally more reliable. Therefore, while both methods can be used to mount a disk, using the blkid (option D) is typically more reliable and less prone to errors or conflicts. upvoted 2 times e4181371 year, 5 months ago There is no block id. upvoted 1 times DRVision1 year, 7 months ago When a server is cloned, the filesystem labels (mount disk by-label) are also cloned. This means that if both the original and cloned servers are on the same network, there could be two disks with the same label, leading to confusion and potential errors. On the other hand, the block ID (blkid) is unique for each block device, even across clones. This means that even if a disk is cloned, the clone will have a different blkid. Therefore, mounting by blkid avoids the potential conflicts that can arise when cloning servers. So, even in the case of server cloning, using the blkid (option D) is typically more reliable and less prone to errors or conflicts. It ensures that the correct disk is mounted, regardless of any changes in the hardware configuration or cloning of disks. upvoted 1 times e4181371 year, 5 months ago There is no block id. upvoted 1 times wait4thebus1 year, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C See comment below.

Since the UUIDs of the source of the clone are unique to just that source device and mean nothing to anything else, it would make sense to use the more generic mount disk by-label method. So, C would be the answer. upvoted 2 times linux_admin2 years, 5 months ago Selected Answer: D The \"mount disk by-blkid\" option allows the administrator to mount the disk using a unique identifier (the block ID) instead of the device name. This is particularly useful when cloning a server and the device names have changed, as it helps to ensure that the correct disk is being mounted. The \"mount disk by device-id\" option is not correct because it does not exist in the standard Linux mount command. The \"fsck -A\" option is used to check and repair file systems, but it does not mount the disk. The \"mount disk by-label\" option is also incorrect as it mounts the disk based on the disk label, but if the disk label has changed as a result of the clone, this option will not work. upvoted 1 times linux_admin2 years, 5 months ago ***Discard*** upvoted 2 times e4181371 year, 5 months ago There is no block id. upvoted 1 times lo_01234_ol2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C Here ya' go: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/644708/how-can-i-prevent-disk-uuid-mismatch-when-cloning-a-machine upvoted 3 times Nvoid2 years, 8 months ago Device label better, i'm actually going to have to do this once i start my job doing this. lol upvoted 2 times Nvoid2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: A I changed by vote to A - Device ID is better, Ref: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en- us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_file_systems/assembly_overview-of-persistent-naming-attributes_managing-file-systems upvoted 1 times TheRealManish2 years, 8 months ago I don't know man, your link talks about UUID. selection A is referring to \"device-id\" which is not in your link, and doesnt really show up on google as anything meaningful in regards to linux. upvoted 1 times TheRealManish2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C According to this link the answer should be C: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/644708/how-can-i-prevent-disk-uuid-mismatch-when- cloning-a-machine upvoted 4 times TheRealManish2 years, 8 months ago not feeling super confident here, does anyone else have thoughts? upvoted 1 times Nvoid2 years, 8 months ago blkid is a command, i'm choosing C, i remember from the class i took Label is more reliable and easier to work with. upvoted 2 times linux_adminHighly Voted 11 months, 3 weeks ago B. lscpu The lscpu command is used to display information about the CPU architecture and the system topology on Linux systems.

So the correct answer is A: The process mysqld is using too many semaphores. Semaphores are used to control access to shared resources in a system. When a process requires access to a shared resource, it acquires a semaphore. When the process has finished using the resource, it releases the semaphore. If a process requires too many semaphores, it can cause other processes to block, leading to performance issues. In this case, the mysqld process is using too many semaphores, causing connections to the MariaDB service to be closed unexpectedly.

Here is a breakdown of the command: sed: a command-line utility for processing text -i: a command-line option that instructs sed to edit the file in place, rather than outputting the edited text to the console 's/auto/persistent/g': the sed command to be executed. This command consists of three parts: s: a command to substitute (replace) text auto: the search pattern to look for in the file persistent: the replacement pattern to replace the search pattern g: a global option that means to replace all occurrences of the search pattern in the file, not just the first occurrence. upvoted 2 times linux_admin1 year, 10 months ago The command sed -i 'persistent/s/^#//q' /etc/systemd/journald.conf attempts to remove a comment symbol # before the word \"persistent\" in the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file. sed: a command-line utility for processing text -i: a command-line option that instructs sed to edit the file in place, rather than outputting the edited text to the console 'persistent/s/^#//q': the sed command to be executed. This command consists of three parts: persistent: the search pattern to look for in the file /: a delimiter that separates the search pattern from the replacement pattern ^#//q: the replacement pattern and a command to quit after the first match is found. The ^# means \"replace the first occurrence of a comment symbol at the beginning of the line with nothing,\" and the q means \"quit immediately after the replacement is made.\" Note that the persistent search pattern and the # comment symbol are separated by a caret (^) character, which is a regular expression metacharacter that matches the start of a line. upvoted 2 times KnifeClown11 year, 10 months ago Selected Answer: C C for real upvoted 2 times KnifeClown11 year, 10 months ago C. sed -i 's/auto/persistent/g' /etc/systemd/journald.conf && sed -i 'persistent/s/ˆ#//q' /etc/systemd/journald.conf upvoted 2 times Pinnubhai1 year, 11 months ago Selected Answer: C Replace storage type with Storage=persistent # sed -i 's/#Storage.*/Storage=persistent/' /etc/systemd/journald.conf Next you can restart systemd-journald service # systemctl restart systemd-journald.service upvoted 1 times Ckl222 years ago Selected Answer: C C does appear to be the only one that would make the logs persistent upvoted 1 times MissAllen2 years, 1 month ago I don't see any correct answer, but C is the closest.

Restarting the journald service doesn't help if you made no changes to the.conf file!. Answer C searches for the pattern \"auto\", globally in the same file, but replaces it with the pattern \"persistent\", in the file (that is the -i option).

The CPU is overloaded. The load average of 9.90 indicates that there are, on average, 9.90 processes in the running or runnable state. Given that there is only a single CPU, this means that there are far more processes needing CPU time than the CPU can handle, leading to an overloaded CPU. This is likely the cause of the slowness. The other options (A, C, and D) do not seem to be supported by the provided output. The output does not indicate that the system is running out of swap space (almost all free), that the memory is exhausted (still have a lot of free mem), or that the processes are paging (only 5 for pages used).

High values (>0 consistently) in the b column (blocked [aka waiting] PROCESSES) also support the indication of I/O bottlenecks related to PAGING. Heavy PAGING indicates that PROCESSES are waiting for data to be read from or written to swap space, which causes the observed I/O bottleneck and system slowness.

The valid prefix lengths depend on the address class and type. For IPv4 addresses, the prefix length must be between 0 and 32.

This command will remove all containers, including those that are running, stopped, and exited. docker rm --state exited, on the other hand, only removes containers in an exited state. The --state option is used to specify the state of the containers to be removed, and exited is the state that we want to remove. This command is useful for cleaning up containers that have exited and are no longer needed, freeing up resources and disk space occupied by these containers.

Option A (grep -ln denied) would print the name of the file and the line number of the occurrence of \"denied\", but it doesn't meet the requirement of including both uppercase and lowercase occurrences. Option B (grep -nv denied) would print the name of the file and the line number of all the lines that do not contain \"denied\", which is not what is required. Option C (grep -wL denied) would print the name of the files that do not contain the exact word \"denied\" (i.e., it would exclude files that contain \"permission denied\" or \"access denied\"), which is also not what is required. upvoted 3 times KnifeClown11 year, 4 months ago Selected Answer: D D. find. -type f -print | xargs grep -li denied The command find. -type f -print | xargs grep -li denied will accomplish the task.

The output from the find command is then passed to xargs, which is used to execute the grep command on each file. The grep command is used to search for occurrences of the word \"denied\". The -l option causes grep to print only the names of the files that contain a match, and the -i option causes grep to perform a case-insensitive search, so that both uppercase and lowercase occurrences of the word \"denied\" will be matched. upvoted 1 times Nvoid1 year, 7 months ago Selected Answer: D need the -i for ignore case going with `D` !! upvoted 4 times Nvoid1 year, 7 months ago btw its xargs not xrags, mod please fix."},{"id":"PDF135","domain":"From PDFs","difficulty":2,"type":"single","stem":"A Linux administrator reviews a set of log output files and needs to identify files that contain any occurrence of the word denied.

Uptime is simply a measure of the time the system has been running without any downtime. It is possible for a system to run for much longer without requiring a reboot.

We can see that there is a local DNS entry mapping portal.comptia.org -> 10.10.10.55. But, the actual DNS resolution, from the `host` command, is different, portal.comptia.org -> 192.168.1.55. Something is taking priority over the local DNS in /etc/hosts. If we delete the entry in /etc/hosts, I doubt it will resolve our connection problem, because the system is getting its DNS resolution from something else, possibly a cache. I think we should flush the local DNS cache and try again. We should also verify what is the correct IP it should resolve to. Perhaps we SHOULD also remove the entry from /etc/hosts, but for the reason that the private DNS server (at 10.10.10.5) should be responsible for resolving DNS, not workstations. upvoted 3 times BlackSkullz10 months, 1 week ago Selected Answer: AD When a service is masked, it cannot start on boot or be started manually.

The default route is the route that is used when no other route matches the destination of a packet. The default route is usually the gateway that connects the local network to the Internet. The server configuration shows that there are two default routes in the routing table, one with the gateway 192.168.1.1 and the other with the gateway 10.0.0.1. This can cause a conflict and confusion for the server when deciding which gateway to use for the outgoing packets. Some pa ckets may be sent to the wrong gateway and fail to reach the Internet, while some packets may be sent to the correct gateway and work as intended. This can result in intermittent connection is sues and inconsistent behavior. The administrator should remove one of the default routes and keep only the correct one for the network.

The LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a tool for managing disk sp ace on Linux systems. The LVM allows the administrator to create logical volumes that span ac ross multiple physical volumes, such as hard disks or partitions. The LVM also supports different ty pes of logical volumes, such as linear, striped, or mirrored. A mirrored logical volume is a type of lo gical volume that creates a copy of the data on another physical volume, providing redundancy and fault tolerance.

Application Control can also prevent malware, untrusted, or unwanted applications from running on th e network, reducing the risks and costs associated with data breaches1. Application Control can also improve the overall network stability and performance by eliminating unnecessary or harmful applications1. Application Control is not mainly used to filter out specific c ontent, although it can be combined with other technologies such as URL f iltering or content filtering t o achieve that goal.

This can be inferred from the output of the top command, which shows the percentage of CPU ti me spent in different states. The wa state stands for wait, and it indicates that the CPU is idle while waiting for an I/O operation to complete. In this case, the wa state is 52.4%, which means that more than half of the CPU time is wasted on waiting for data inputs. This can cause a high I/O la tency and affect the performance of the server.

The inod es is at full capacity and would affect file creation for users. An inode is a data structure tha t stores information about a fi le or directory, such as its name, size, permissions, owner, timestamps, and location on the disk. Each file or directory has a unique inode number that identifies it. The number of inodes on a filesystem is fixed when the filesystem is created, and it determines how many files and directories can b e created on that filesystem. If the inodes are exhausted, no new files or directories can be create d, even if there is enough disk space available. The output for the second command shows that the /ftpusers/ fil esystem has 0% of inodes available, which means that all the inodes have been used up. This would p revent users from creating new files on the FTP server. The administrator should either delete some unused files or directories to free up some inodes, or resize the filesystem to increase the number of inodes. The other options are incorrect because: A) The users do not have the correct permissions to create file s on the FTP server.

DNS servers are responsible for translating hostn ames into IP addresses, and vi ce versa. If the application server has incorrect or unreachable DNS servers configured, it will not be able to resolve the hostname of the database server and communicate with it. To troubleshoot this issue, the systems engineer should check the DNS configuration on the application server, which is usually stored in the /etc/resolv.conf file.

D. Only root can create files in /comptia."],"answer":[0],"explanation":"Explanation: The output shows the file access control list (FACL) of the /co mptia directory, which is an extension of the standard Linux permissions that allows more fine-grained co ntrol over file and directory access1. The FACL consists of two parts: the access ACL and the default ACL. The access ACL applies to the current object, while the default ACL applies to the objects cr eated within the directory2. The access ACL has three entrie s: user, group, and other. These are similar to the standard Linux permissions, but they can be specified for individual users or groups as well. The user entry shows that the owner of the directory (root) has read, write, and exe cute permissions (rwx). The group entry shows that the group owner of the directory (root) has re ad and execute permissions (r-x). The other entry shows that all other users have no permissions (”). The default ACL has five entries: user, group, group:wheel, mas k, and other. These are applied to any files or directories created within /compti a. The user entry shows that the owner of the new object will h ave read, write, and execute permissions (rwx). The group entry shows that the group owner o f the new object will have read and execute permissions (r-x). The group:wheel entry shows that the members of the wheel group will have read, write, and execute permissions (rwx) on the new object. The mask entry shows that the maximum permissions allowed for any user or group are read, wri te, and execute (rwx). The other entry shows that all other users will have no permissions (”) o n the new object. Therefore, based on the FACL out put, members of the wheel group can read files in /comptia, as they have read permission on both the directory and any files within it. Option B is incorrect because the sticky bit is not set on /comptia or any files within it. The s ticky bit is a special permission that prevents users from deleting or renaming files that they do not own in a shared directory3. It is symbolized by a t character in th e execute position of others. Option C is incorrect because other users cannot create files in /co mptia, as they have no permissi ons on the directory or any files within it. Option D is incorrect because root is not the only user who can create files in /comptia. Any user who has write permission on the directory can create files within it, such as members of the wheel group.","outputs":["<exhibit restored> This item expected an exhibit/output."]},{"id":"PDF566","domain":"From PDFs","difficulty":2,"type":"single","stem":"After connecting to a remote host via SSH, an administrator attempts to run an application but receives the following error: [user@workstation ~]$ ssh admin@srv1 Last login: Tue Mar 29 18:03:34 2022 [admin@srvl ~] $ /usr/local/bin/config_manager Error: cannot open display: [admin@srv1 ~] $ Which of the following should the administrator do to resolve t his error?","choices":["Disconnect from the SSH sessio n and reconnect using the ssh -x command.","Add Options X11 to the /home/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys file.","Open port 6000 on the workstation and restart the firewalld service.","Enable X11 forwarding in /etc/ssh/ssh_config and restart the server."],"answer":[0],"explanation":"Explanation: The error indicates that the application requires an X11 displa y, but the SSH session does not forward the X11 connection.

If the SSH server was not running on the remote server, the port would be shown as closed, which means that nmap received a TCP RST packet in response to its probe.
