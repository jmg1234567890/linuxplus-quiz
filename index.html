Given the following command outputs:  Which of the following is the reason that the administrator is unable to perform the assigned duties?    The reason that the administrator is unable to perform the assigned duties is because the administrator is not a part of the correct group. This is option B. Based on the image that you sent, I can see that the user comptia has a user ID and a group ID of 1000, and belongs to only one group, which is also comptia. However, the sudoers file, which defines the permissions for users to run commands as root or other users, does not include the comptia group in any of the entries. Therefore, the user comptia cannot use sudo to perform privileged functions on the system. The other options are incorrect because: A) The administrator needs a password reset. tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 This is not true, because the password aging information for the user comptia shows that the password was last changed on Oct 24, 2023, and it does not expire until Jan 22, 2024. There is no indication that the password is locked or expired. C) The administrator did not update the sudo database. This is not necessary, because the sudo database is automatically updated whenever the sudoers file is modified. There is no separate command to update the sudo database. D) The administrators credentials need to be more complex. This is not relevant, because the complexity of the credentials does not affect the ability to use sudo. The sudoers file does not specify any password policy for the users or groups that are allowed to use sudo.</div>\n      <ul class='choices'>\n        <li><label><input type='radio' name='q224' value='A'> A.

Which of the following commands will allow the administrator to load the KVM module as well as any related dependencies?    This command will load the KVM module as well as any related dependencies, such as kvm-intel or kvm-amd, depending on the processor type. The modprobe command is a Linux utility that reads the /etc/modules.conf file and adds or removes modules from the kernel. It also resolves any dependencies between modules, so that they are loaded in the correct order. The other options are incorrect because: B) insmod kvm This command will only load the KVM module, but not any related dependencies. The insmod command is a low-level Linux utility that inserts a single module into the kernel. It does not resolve any dependencies between modules, so they have to be loaded manually. C) depmod kvm This command will not load the KVM module at all, but only create a list of module dependencies for modprobe to use. The depmod command is a Linux utility that scans the installed modules and tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 generates a file called modules.dep that contains dependency information for each module. D) hotplug kvm This command is invalid and does not exist. The hotplug mechanism is a feature of the Linux kernel that allows devices to be added or removed while the system is running.

Which of the following commands will grant the request?    This command will allow the systems administrator to change the password of another user account in the system. The sudo prefix will grant the administrator the necessary privileges to perform this action, and the passwd command will prompt for the new password for the specified user. For example, if the administrator wants to change the password of a user named tom, the command will look like this: sudo passwd tom The other options are incorrect because: B) sudo userdel This command will delete a user account from the system, not change its credentials. The userdel command removes the users entry from the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files, as well as deletes the users home directory and mail spool. This is not what the request asked for. C) sudo chage This command will change the password expiration and aging information for a user account, not its credentials. The chage command can be used to set or modify various parameters related to password aging, such as the minimum and maximum number of days between password changes, the number of days before password expiration to issue a warning, and so on. This is not what the request asked for. D) sudo usermod This command will modify various attributes of a user account, such as its login name, home tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 directory, default shell, primary group, and so on. However, it cannot change the users password directly. To do that, the usermod command requires the -p option followed by an encrypted password string, which is not easy to generate manually. Therefore, this is not a practical way to change a users credentials.

Due to security concerns, the DevOps engineer does not want to keep a sensitive configuration file, app . conf, in the repository. Which of the following should the engineer do to prevent the file from being uploaded to the repository?    This will prevent the file app.conf from being tracked by Git and uploaded to the repository. The .gitignore file is a special file that contains patterns of files and directories that Git should ignore. Any file that matches a pattern in the .gitignore file will not be staged, committed, or pushed to the remote repository. The .gitignore file should be placed in the root directory of the repository and committed along with the other files. The other options are incorrect because: A) Run git exclude app.conf This is not a valid Git command. There is no such thing as git exclude. The closest thing is git updateindex --assume-unchanged, which tells Git to temporarily ignore changes to a file, but it does not prevent the file from being uploaded to the repository. B) Run git stash app.conf This will temporarily save the changes to the file app.conf in a stash, which is a hidden storage area for uncommitted changes. However, this does not prevent the file from being tracked by Git or uploaded to the repository. The file will still be part of the working tree and the index, and it will be tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 restored when the stash is popped or applied. C) Add app.conf to .exclude This will have no effect, because Git does not recognize a file named .exclude. The only files that Git uses to ignore files are .gitignore, $GIT_DIR/info/exclude, and core.excludesFile.

Which of the following commands can the administrator use to display all the firewall rules applied to the Linux servers? (Select two).  E. ufw status F. iptables ”A   These commands can display all the firewall rules applied to the Linux servers, depending on which firewall service is being used. The firewall-cmd command is a utility for managing firewalld, which is a dynamic firewall service that supports zones and services. The --list-all option will show all the settings and rules for the default zone, or for a specific zone if specified. For example, firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=public will show the rules for the public zone1. The ufw command is a frontend for iptables, which is a low-level tool for manipulating netfilter, the Linux kernels packet filtering framework. The status option will show the status of ufw and the active rules, or the numbered rules if verbose is specified. For example, ufw status verbose will show the numbered rules and other information2. The other options are incorrect because: A) ufw limit tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 This command will limit the connection attempts to a service or port using iptables recent module. It does not display any firewall rules2. B) iptables -F This command will flush (delete) all the rules in the selected chain, or all chains if none is given. It does not display any firewall rules3. C) systemctl status firewalld This command will show the status of the firewalld service, including whether it is active or not, but it does not show the firewall rules4.

Which of the following best represents the sequence the administrator should execute to accomplish this task?  sh script.sh systemct1 isolate graphical.target sh script.sh systemct1 isolate multi-user.target systemct1 isolate multi-user.target systemct1 isolate graphical.target systemct1 isolate graphical.target sh script.sh   The correct answer is graphical.target This sequence will allow the administrator to switch from the graphical mode to the console mode, tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 run the script, and then switch back to the graphical mode. The systemctl command is used to control the systemd system and service manager, which manages the boot targets and services on Linux systems. The isolate subcommand starts the unit specified on the command line and its dependencies and stops all others. The multi-user.target is a boot target that provides a text-based console login, while the graphical.target is a boot target that provides a graphical user interface. By using systemctl isolate, the administrator can change the boot target on the fly without rebooting the system. The sh command is used to run a shell script, which is a file that contains a series of commands that can be executed by the shell. The script.sh is the name of the script that contains the application change that the administrator needs to make. By running sh script.sh, the administrator can execute the script in the console mode. The other options are incorrect because: B) systemctl isolate graphical.target sh script.sh systemctl isolate multi-user.target This sequence will switch from the console mode to the graphical mode, run the script, and then switch back to the console mode. This is not what the administrator wants to do, as the script must be run only in console mode. C) sh script.sh systemctl isolate multi-user.target systemctl isolate graphical.target This sequence will run the script in the current mode, which may or may not be console mode, and then switch to console mode and back to graphical mode. This is not what the administrator wants to do, as the script must be run only in console mode. D) systemctl isolate multi-user.target systemctl isolate graphical.target sh script.sh This sequence will switch from graphical mode to console mode and then back to graphical mode, without running the script at all. This is not what the administrator wants to do, as the script must be run only in console mode.

The administrator sees the following when listing the repository: tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025  The administrator notices the file . DS STORE should not be included and deletes it from the online repository. Which of the following should the administrator run from the root of the local repository before the next commit to ensure the file is not uploaded again in future commits?    The correct answer is D. The administrator should run œecho .DS STORE >> .gitignore  from the root of the local repository before the next commit to ensure the file is not uploaded again in future commits. This command will append the file name .DS STORE to the end of the .gitignore file, which is a special file that tells Git to ignore certain files or directories that should not be tracked or uploaded to the repository. By adding .DS STORE to the .gitignore file, the administrator will prevent Git from staging, committing, or pushing this file in the future. The other options are incorrect because: A) rm -f .DS STORE && git push This command will delete the file .DS STORE from the local repository and then push the changes to the remote repository. However, this does not prevent the file from being uploaded again in future commits, if it is recreated or copied to the local repository. B) git fetch && git checkout .DS STORE This command will fetch the latest changes from the remote repository and then restore the file .DS STORE from the remote repository to the local repository. This is not what the administrator wants to do, as this will undo the deletion of the file from the online repository. tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 C) rm -f .DS STORE && git rebase origin main This command will delete the file .DS STORE from the local repository and then rebase the local branch onto the main branch of the remote repository.

The administrator runs the following commands:  Which of the following is the cause of the issue based on the output above?    The cause of the issue based on the output above is C. The inodes is at full capacity and would affect file creation for users. tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 An inode is a data structure that stores information about a file or directory, such as its name, size, permissions, owner, timestamps, and location on the disk. Each file or directory has a unique inode number that identifies it. The number of inodes on a filesystem is fixed when the filesystem is created, and it determines how many files and directories can be created on that filesystem. If the inodes are exhausted, no new files or directories can be created, even if there is enough disk space available. The output for the second command shows that the /ftpusers/ filesystem has 0% of inodes available, which means that all the inodes have been used up. This would prevent users from creating new files on the FTP server. The administrator should either delete some unused files or directories to free up some inodes, or resize the filesystem to increase the number of inodes. The other options are incorrect because: A) The users do not have the correct permissions to create files on the FTP server. This is not true, because the output for the first command shows that the /ftpusers/ filesystem has 26% of disk space available, which means that there is enough space for users to create files. The permissions of the files and directories are not shown in the output, but they are not relevant to the issue of inode exhaustion. B) The ftpusers filesystem does not have enough space. This is not true, because the output for the first command shows that the /ftpusers/ filesystem has 26% of disk space available, which means that there is enough space for users to create files. The issue is not related to disk space, but to inode capacity. D) ftpusers is mounted as read only. This is not true, because the output for the first command does not show any indication that the /ftpusers/ filesystem is mounted as read only. If it was, it would have an (ro) flag next to the mounted on column. A read only filesystem would prevent users from creating or modifying files on the FTP server, but it would not affect the inode usage.</div>\n      <ul class='choices'>\n        <li><label><input type='radio' name='q231' value='A'> A.

The tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 administrator noticed issues during the startup of the service. Given the following outputs: Which of the following commands will fix the issue? The correct answer is tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 A) semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 2222 This command will allow the SSH server to bind to port 2222 by adding it to the SELinux policy. The semanage command is a utility for managing SELinux policies. The port subcommand is used to manage network port definitions. The -a option is used to add a new record, the -t option is used to specify the SELinux type, the -p option is used to specify the protocol, and the tcp 2222 argument is used to specify the port number. The ssh_port_t type is the default type for SSH ports in SELinux. The other options are incorrect because: B) chcon system_u:object_r:ssh_home_t /etc/ssh/* This command will change the SELinux context of all files under /etc/ssh/ to system_u:object_r:ssh_home_t, which is not correct. The ssh_home_t type is used for user home directories that are accessed by SSH, not for SSH configuration files. The correct type for SSH configuration files is sshd_config_t. C) iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -j ACCEPT This command will add a rule to the iptables firewall to accept incoming TCP connections on port 2222. However, this is not enough to fix the issue, as SELinux will still block the SSH server from binding to that port. Moreover, iptables may not be the default firewall service on some Linux distributions, such as Fedora or CentOS, which use firewalld instead. D) firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=2222/tcp This command will add a rule to the firewalld firewall to allow incoming TCP connections on port 2222 in the public zone. However, this is not enough to fix the issue, as SELinux will still block the SSH server from binding to that port. Moreover, firewalld may not be installed or enabled on some Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu or Debian, which use iptables instead.

The engineer would like to switch from the main branch to the staging branch but notices the staging branch does not exist. Which of the following Git commands should the engineer use to perform this task?  tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025   The correct answer is D. git checkout -b staging This command will create a new branch named staging and switch to it. The git checkout command is used to switch between branches or restore files from a specific branch. The -b option is used to create a new branch if it does not exist. For example, git checkout -b staging will create and switch to the staging branch. The other options are incorrect because: A) git branch -m staging This command will rename the current branch to staging, not switch to it. The git branch command is used to list, create, or delete branches. The -m option is used to rename a branch. For example, git branch -m staging will rename the current branch to staging. B) git commit -m staging This command will commit the changes in the working tree to the current branch with a message of staging, not switch to it. The git commit command is used to record changes to the repository. The - m option is used to specify a commit message. For example, git commit -m staging will commit the changes with a message of staging. C) git status -b staging This command will show the status of the working tree and the current branch, not switch to it. The git status command is used to show the state of the working tree and the staged changes. The -b option is used to show the name of the current branch. However, this option does not take an argument, so specifying staging after it will cause an error.

Which of the following commands should the group owner execute?  tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025   The correct answer is A) chmod g+s /home/test This command will set the setgid bit on the /home/test directory, which means that any file or subdirectory created in the directory will inherit the group ownership of the directory. This way, the group permissions on files created in the directory will be preserved. The chmod command is used to change the permissions of files and directories. The g+s option is used to set the setgid bit for the group. The other options are incorrect because: B) chgrp test /home/test This command will change the group ownership of the /home/test directory to test, but it will not affect the group ownership of files created in the directory. The chgrp command is used to change the group of files and directories. The test /home/test arguments are used to specify the new group and the target directory. C) chmod 777 /home/test This command will give read, write, and execute permissions to everyone (owner, group, and others) on the /home/test directory, but it will not affect the group ownership or permissions of files created in the directory. The chmod command is used to change the permissions of files and directories. The 777 argument is an octal number that represents the permissions in binary form. D) chown -hR test /home/test This command will change the owner and group of the /home/test directory and all its contents recursively to test, but it will not preserve the original group permissions on files created in the directory. The chown command is used to change the owner and group of files and directories. The - hR option is used to affect symbolic links and operate on all files and directories recursively. The test /home/test arguments are used to specify the new owner and group and the target directory.

The engineer confirms that the application server can ping the database server's IP address. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the issue?    This is because the application server can ping the database servers IP address, but not its hostname, which suggests that the DNS resolution is not working properly. DNS servers are responsible for translating hostnames into IP addresses, and vice versa. If the application server has incorrect or unreachable DNS servers configured, it will not be able to resolve the hostname of the database server and communicate with it. To troubleshoot this issue, the systems engineer should check the DNS configuration on the application server, which is usually stored in the /etc/resolv.conf file. This file should contain valid nameserver entries that point to the DNS servers that can resolve the database servers hostname. For example, a typical /etc/resolv.conf file may look like this: nameserver 8.8.8.8 nameserver 8.8.4.4 These are the IP addresses of Googles public DNS servers, which can be used as a fallback option if the default DNS servers are not working. Alternatively, the systems engineer can use the nslookup or dig commands to test the DNS resolution of the database servers hostname from the application server. These commands will query a specified DNS server and return the IP address of the hostname, or an error message if the resolution fails. For example, to query Googles public DNS server for the IP address of comptia.org, the command would be: nslookup comptia.org 8.8.8.8 or dig comptia.org @8.8.8.8</div>\n      <ul class='choices'>\n        <li><label><input type='radio' name='q235' value='A'> A.

This command will increase the size of the receive and send buffers for the network interface, which can improve the network performance and reduce packet loss. The sysctl command will apply the changes to the kernel parameters without rebooting the system. The other commands are either incorrect or not suitable for this task. For example: A) # echo ˜net.core.net_backlog = 5000000 >> /etc/sysctl.conf # sysctl -p # systemctl daemon-reload will try to increase the backlog queue for incoming connections, but this is not relevant for the latency issue. The systemctl daemon-reload command is also unnecessary, as it only reloads the systemd configuration files, not the kernel parameters. B) # ifdown eth0 # ip link set dev eth0 mtu 800 # ifup eth0 will try to change the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the network interface to 800 bytes, but this is too low and may cause fragmentation and performance degradation. The default MTU for Ethernet is 1500 bytes, and it should not be changed unless there is a specific reason. C) # systemctl stop network # ethtool -g eth0 512 # systemctl start network will try to change the ring buffer size of the network interface to 512, but this is too small and may cause packet drops and latency spikes.

The output shows the file access control list (FACL) of the /comptia directory, which is an extension of the standard Linux permissions that allows more fine-grained control over file and directory access1. The FACL consists of two parts: the access ACL and the default ACL. The access ACL applies to the current object, while the default ACL applies to the objects created within the directory2. The access ACL has three entries: user, group, and other. These are similar to the standard Linux permissions, but they can be specified for individual users or groups as well. The user entry shows that the owner of the directory (root) has read, write, and execute permissions (rwx). The group entry shows that the group owner of the directory (root) has read and execute permissions (r-x). The other entry shows that all other users have no permissions (”). The default ACL has five entries: user, group, group:wheel, mask, and other. These are applied to any files or directories created within /compti a. The user entry shows that the owner of the new object will have read, write, and execute permissions (rwx). The group entry shows that the group owner of the new object will have read and execute permissions (r-x). The group:wheel entry shows that the members of the wheel group will have read, write, and execute permissions (rwx) on the new object. The mask entry shows that the maximum permissions allowed for any user or group are read, write, and execute (rwx). The other entry shows that all other users will have no permissions (”) on the new object. Therefore, based on the FACL output, members of the wheel group can read files in /comptia, as they have read permission on both the directory and any files within it. Option B is incorrect because the sticky bit is not set on /comptia or any files within it. The sticky bit is a special permission that prevents users from deleting or renaming files that they do not own in a shared directory3. It is symbolized by a t character in the execute position of others. Option C is incorrect because other tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 users cannot create files in /comptia, as they have no permissions on the directory or any files within it.

(Select three).  E. CNAME F. RRSIG G. SOA H. TXT I. SRV   The Linux administrator should request the following types of DNS records from the DNS team: A: This record type is used to map a hostname to an IPv4 address. The administrator needs four A records for devel.comptia.org, one for each IP address (5.5.5.1, 5.5.5.2, 5.5.5.3, 5.5.5.4). This will allow users to access the web servers by using the hostname devel.comptia.org instead of the IP addresses1. CNAME: This record type is used to create an alias for another hostname. The administrator needs two CNAME records, one for dev.comptia.org and one for development.comptia.org, both pointing to devel.comptia.org. This will allow users to access the web servers by using any of these three tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 hostnames interchangeably1. NS: This record type is used to delegate a domain or a subdomain to another name server. The administrator needs one NS record for comptia.org, pointing to 5.5.5.254, which is the name server that hosts the records for the subdomain devel.comptia.org2. This will allow users to resolve the hostnames under comptia.org by querying the name server 5.5.5.2542. The other record types are not relevant for the administrators task: MX: This record type is used to specify the mail exchange server for a domain or a subdomain1. The administrator does not need this record type because the web servers are not intended to handle email traffic. PTR: This record type is used to map an IP address to a hostname, which is the reverse of an A record1. The administrator does not need this record type because the web servers are not expected to be accessed by their IP addresses. RRSIG: This record type is used to provide digital signatures for DNSSEC, which is a security extension for DNS that verifies the authenticity and integrity of DNS responses3. The administrator does not need this record type because it is not mentioned in the task requirements. SOA: This record type is used to provide information about the authoritative name server and other parameters for a domain or a subdomain1. The administrator does not need this record type because it is usually created automatically by the name server software when a new zone file is created4. TXT: This record type is used to store arbitrary text data that can be used for various purposes, such as SPF, DKIM, DMARC, etc1. The administrator does not need this record type because it is not related to the web server functionality. SRV: This record type is used to specify the location and port number of a service that runs on a domain or a subdomain1. The administrator does not need this record type because the web servers use the standard HTTP port 80, which does not require an SRV record.

The administrator reviews the following output: [ root@server ] # id user1 UID=1011 (user1) gid=1011 (USER1) groups=1011 (user1), 101 (www-data), 1120 (webadmin) [ root@server ] # cat /etc/sudoers.d/custom.conf user1 ALL=/usr/sbin/systemctl start httpd, /usr/sbin/systemctl stop httpd webadmin ALL=NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d.httpd restart, /sbin/service httpd restart, /usr/sbin/apache2ctl restart #%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL Which of the following would most likely resolve the issue while maintaining a least privilege security model? The custom.conf file grants sudo privileges to user1 and webadmin for managing the Apache web service, but it uses different commands for each of them. User1 is allowed to use systemctl to start and stop the httpd service, while webadmin is allowed to use init.d, service, or apache2ctl to restart the httpd service. However, the user1 is unable to restart the service, only start and stop it. To fix this, user1 should be able to use the same commands as webadmin, which can be achieved by listing webadmin as a group in the custom.conf file, using the syntax %groupname. This way, user1 will inherit the sudo privileges of the webadmin group, and be able to restart the Apache web service without compromising the least privilege security model.

Not shown: 979 closed ports PORT STATE SERVICE 21/tcp open ftp 22/tcp filtered ssh 631/tcp open ipp Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.06 seconds Which of the following can be said about the remote server? This is because the port 22/tcp is shown as filtered by nmap, which means that nmap cannot determine whether the port is open or closed because a firewall or other device is blocking its probes. If the SSH server was not running on the remote server, the port would be shown as closed, which means that nmap received a TCP RST packet in response to its probe. If the remote SSH server was using SSH protocol version 1, the port would be shown as open, which means that nmap received a TCP SYN/ACK packet in response to its probe. If the SSH host key on the remote server had expired, the port would also be shown as open, but the SSH client would display a warning message about the host key verification failure. Therefore, the best explanation for the filtered state of the port 22/tcp is that a firewall is preventing nmap from reaching the SSH server.

As the web search results show, processes in state Z are defunct or zombie processes, which means they have terminated but their parent process has not reaped them properly. They do not consume any resources, but they occupy a slot in the process table. To remove them from the process list, the administrator needs to kill the parent process of the zombies, which will cause them to be reaped by the init process (PID 1). Killing the zombies themselves or the init process will not have any effect, as they are already dead.
