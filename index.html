It is commonly used for authentication and managing user information in enterprise environments. MFA (Multi-factor Authentication): A security process in which a user is required to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource, such as a website or application. These factors typically include something the user knows (password), something the user has (a mobile phone or token), and something the user is (fingerprint or other biometrics). SSO (Single Sign-On): A user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials. This reduces the need to remember multiple passwords and improves user convenience. PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module): A framework that allows system administrators to configure authentication methods for applications on Unix-like systems. It enables the integration of different authentication technologies (like password-based, biometrics, or MFA) without changing the applications themselves. upvoted 2 times Alizadeh10 months, 2 weeks ago Selected Answer: A The answer is A.

The issue of the job only running daily is likely due to an incorrect OnCalendar schedule in the timer definition. The OnCalendar directive is used in the timer definition to specify the schedule on which the timer should run. If the schedule is incorrect, the timer will not run as expected. For example, if the administrator wants the job to run every two hours, the OnCalendar directive in the timer definition should be set to *:0/2.

The OnCalendar directive is used in the timer definition to specify the schedule on which the timer should run. If the schedule is incorrect, the timer will not run as expected, regardless of the state of the system-daemon services.

By default, systemd timers are configured to use UTC time. If the administrator specified an incorrect OnCalendar schedule, the timer may not run as expected. To schedule a job to run every two hours, the correct OnCalendar schedule should be \"0 */2 * * *\". This will run the job every two hours, starting at the top of the hour (i.e., at 0 minutes past the hour). If the administrator did not specify the correct OnCalendar schedule, the timer may be set to run daily or at some other incorrect interval, which would explain the behavior observed in the log file. upvoted 4 times Nvoid2 years, 7 months ago Selected Answer: C Picking C Here. upvoted 4 times SaadiaS2 years, 7 months ago *:0/2 The task will be executed every two minutes starting from the minute 0 https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-schedule-tasks-with-systemd-timers-in-linux upvoted 1 times SaadiaS2 years, 7 months ago Selected answer C upvoted 2 times ryanzou2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C I prefer C upvoted 4 times bjornborg2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C OnCalendar setting is wrong.

The \"echo \"umask 377\" >> /home/web/.bashrc\" command will satisfy the requirement by adding the umask setting to the user's.bashrc file. The umask setting determines the default file permissions for newly created files and directories. The value of 377 sets the default permissions to read-only for the owner of the file. The umask is specified in octal notation, and each digit represents the permissions for a different category of users. In this case, the first digit represents the permissions for the owner of the file, the second digit represents the permissions for the group owner of the file, and the third digit represents the permissions for others. A value of 3 means that the owner has read and write permissions, and a value of 7 means that the owner has read, write, and execute permissions.

Specifically, it is responsible for: C. It helps to load the different kernels to initiate the OS startup process. The bootloader, such as GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader), is the first software that runs when a computer starts.

There are not \"different kernels to initiate the OS startup process.\" There's just one at a time. Obviously, the bootloader discovers and initializes the hardware that that kernel needs to use, or the OS would be useless.

It helps to load the different kernels to initiate the OS startup process.\" A bootloader is a program that runs before the operating system (OS) starts. Its main function is to load the OS into memory and initiate the OS startup process. This involves loading the kernel, which is the core part of the OS that manages hardware resources and provides a platform for running user applications. The bootloader helps to load different kernels, which can be useful for testing and recovery purposes.

On the other hand, disk labels are not guaranteed to be unique and can be changed by the user, leading to potential conflicts. Presence: Not all filesystems support labels, and even when they do, labels are not always set by default. This means that you might not be able to mount a disk by label if the label has not been set. In contrast, all block devices have a blkid. Consistency: The blkid remains consistent even if the device name (e.g., /dev/sda, /dev/sdb) changes due to hardware changes or reconfiguration. Disk labels do not have this issue, but combined with the points above, using blkid is generally more reliable. Therefore, while both methods can be used to mount a disk, using the blkid (option D) is typically more reliable and less prone to errors or conflicts. upvoted 2 times e4181371 year, 5 months ago There is no block id. upvoted 1 times DRVision1 year, 7 months ago When a server is cloned, the filesystem labels (mount disk by-label) are also cloned. This means that if both the original and cloned servers are on the same network, there could be two disks with the same label, leading to confusion and potential errors. On the other hand, the block ID (blkid) is unique for each block device, even across clones. This means that even if a disk is cloned, the clone will have a different blkid. Therefore, mounting by blkid avoids the potential conflicts that can arise when cloning servers. So, even in the case of server cloning, using the blkid (option D) is typically more reliable and less prone to errors or conflicts. It ensures that the correct disk is mounted, regardless of any changes in the hardware configuration or cloning of disks. upvoted 1 times e4181371 year, 5 months ago There is no block id. upvoted 1 times wait4thebus1 year, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C See comment below.

Since the UUIDs of the source of the clone are unique to just that source device and mean nothing to anything else, it would make sense to use the more generic mount disk by-label method. So, C would be the answer. upvoted 2 times linux_admin2 years, 5 months ago Selected Answer: D The \"mount disk by-blkid\" option allows the administrator to mount the disk using a unique identifier (the block ID) instead of the device name. This is particularly useful when cloning a server and the device names have changed, as it helps to ensure that the correct disk is being mounted. The \"mount disk by device-id\" option is not correct because it does not exist in the standard Linux mount command. The \"fsck -A\" option is used to check and repair file systems, but it does not mount the disk. The \"mount disk by-label\" option is also incorrect as it mounts the disk based on the disk label, but if the disk label has changed as a result of the clone, this option will not work. upvoted 1 times linux_admin2 years, 5 months ago ***Discard*** upvoted 2 times e4181371 year, 5 months ago There is no block id. upvoted 1 times lo_01234_ol2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C Here ya' go: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/644708/how-can-i-prevent-disk-uuid-mismatch-when-cloning-a-machine upvoted 3 times Nvoid2 years, 8 months ago Device label better, i'm actually going to have to do this once i start my job doing this. lol upvoted 2 times Nvoid2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: A I changed by vote to A - Device ID is better, Ref: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en- us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_file_systems/assembly_overview-of-persistent-naming-attributes_managing-file-systems upvoted 1 times TheRealManish2 years, 8 months ago I don't know man, your link talks about UUID. selection A is referring to \"device-id\" which is not in your link, and doesnt really show up on google as anything meaningful in regards to linux. upvoted 1 times TheRealManish2 years, 8 months ago Selected Answer: C According to this link the answer should be C: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/644708/how-can-i-prevent-disk-uuid-mismatch-when- cloning-a-machine upvoted 4 times TheRealManish2 years, 8 months ago not feeling super confident here, does anyone else have thoughts? upvoted 1 times Nvoid2 years, 8 months ago blkid is a command, i'm choosing C, i remember from the class i took Label is more reliable and easier to work with. upvoted 2 times linux_adminHighly Voted 11 months, 3 weeks ago B. lscpu The lscpu command is used to display information about the CPU architecture and the system topology on Linux systems.

Just look for yourself: 'ls -ld /tmp'. This directory accomplishes the goal of the question.

The sticky bit restricts deletion or renaming of files within the directory to the file owners, the directory owner, or the root user. This means even if a user has write permission to the directory, they cannot delete or rename files owned by others. Setgid and Permissions: Option C sets the setgid bit and gives the group read, write, and execute permissions. The setgid bit causes new files and directories created in the directory to inherit the group ownership of the directory, but it does not prevent file deletion or modification by non-owners. The permissions 770 give the owner and the group full permissions (read, write, execute), but they do not prevent file deletion or modification by non- owners who are in the group. Therefore, to specifically prevent deletion or modification of files from non-owners, option A is the better choice. upvoted 3 times Alizadeh1 year, 5 months ago Selected Answer: C The correct answer is C. chmod 2770 /project/access2all. upvoted 1 times linux_admin1 year, 11 months ago Selected Answer: C C. chmod 2770 /project/access2all. This option sets the setgid (chmod +2) and the permissions rwx (chmod 700) on the directory. This means that files created within the directory will inherit the group ownership of the directory, rather than the user's primary group, and members of the group will have full permissions to read, write, and execute files within the directory. Non-group members will not have access to the directory.

This command consists of three parts: persistent: the search pattern to look for in the file /: a delimiter that separates the search pattern from the replacement pattern ^#//q: the replacement pattern and a command to quit after the first match is found. The ^# means \"replace the first occurrence of a comment symbol at the beginning of the line with nothing,\" and the q means \"quit immediately after the replacement is made.\" Note that the persistent search pattern and the # comment symbol are separated by a caret (^) character, which is a regular expression metacharacter that matches the start of a line. upvoted 2 times KnifeClown11 year, 10 months ago Selected Answer: C C for real upvoted 2 times KnifeClown11 year, 10 months ago C. sed -i 's/auto/persistent/g' /etc/systemd/journald.conf && sed -i 'persistent/s/ˆ#//q' /etc/systemd/journald.conf upvoted 2 times Pinnubhai1 year, 11 months ago Selected Answer: C Replace storage type with Storage=persistent # sed -i 's/#Storage.*/Storage=persistent/' /etc/systemd/journald.conf Next you can restart systemd-journald service # systemctl restart systemd-journald.service upvoted 1 times Ckl222 years ago Selected Answer: C C does appear to be the only one that would make the logs persistent upvoted 1 times MissAllen2 years, 1 month ago I don't see any correct answer, but C is the closest.

The CPU is overloaded. The load average of 9.90 indicates that there are, on average, 9.90 processes in the running or runnable state. Given that there is only a single CPU, this means that there are far more processes needing CPU time than the CPU can handle, leading to an overloaded CPU. This is likely the cause of the slowness. The other options (A, C, and D) do not seem to be supported by the provided output. The output does not indicate that the system is running out of swap space (almost all free), that the memory is exhausted (still have a lot of free mem), or that the processes are paging (only 5 for pages used).

The significant ( >1000 KB/s) si (swap in from disk ) and so (swap out to disk) values indicate that the system is actively PAGING data between RAM and swap space, which significantly slows down performance due to the slow nature of disk I/O compared to RAM access. High values (>0 consistently) in the b column (blocked [aka waiting] PROCESSES) also support the indication of I/O bottlenecks related to PAGING. Heavy PAGING indicates that PROCESSES are waiting for data to be read from or written to swap space, which causes the observed I/O bottleneck and system slowness.

Option A (grep -ln denied) would print the name of the file and the line number of the occurrence of \"denied\", but it doesn't meet the requirement of including both uppercase and lowercase occurrences. Option B (grep -nv denied) would print the name of the file and the line number of all the lines that do not contain \"denied\", which is not what is required. Option C (grep -wL denied) would print the name of the files that do not contain the exact word \"denied\" (i.e., it would exclude files that contain \"permission denied\" or \"access denied\"), which is also not what is required. upvoted 3 times KnifeClown11 year, 4 months ago Selected Answer: D D. find. -type f -print | xargs grep -li denied The command find. -type f -print | xargs grep -li denied will accomplish the task.

The output from the find command is then passed to xargs, which is used to execute the grep command on each file. The grep command is used to search for occurrences of the word \"denied\". The -l option causes grep to print only the names of the files that contain a match, and the -i option causes grep to perform a case-insensitive search, so that both uppercase and lowercase occurrences of the word \"denied\" will be matched. upvoted 1 times Nvoid1 year, 7 months ago Selected Answer: D need the -i for ignore case going with `D` !! upvoted 4 times Nvoid1 year, 7 months ago btw its xargs not xrags, mod please fix."}, {"id": "PDF135", "domain": "From PDFs", "difficulty": 2, "type": "single", "stem": "A Linux administrator reviews a set of log output files and needs to identify files that contain any occurrence of the word denied.

The appliance is based on the Gaia embedded operating system, which is a stripped-down version of Check Point's flagship operating system, Gaia. Gaia is a Linux-based operating system that is used in many of Check Point's security appliances and provides a unified management platform for Check Point's security solutions. Gaia embedded is a smaller version of the operating system that is designed to run on lower-powered devices such as the Quantum Spark appliance. It provides many of the same features as the full Gaia operating system but with a smaller footprint and reduced resource requirements. Therefore, the correct answer is: B.

LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, and it is a standard way of accessing and managing directory services over a network1. However, AD Query is a Windows-specific tool that uses WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) as its underlying protocol2.

Explanation: AD Query is a feature of Check Point security gateways that enables administrators to perform queries against Active Directory Domain Controllers. These queries can be used for a variety of purposes, such as user authentication and authorization, group policy enforcement, and other security- related tasks. To perform these queries, the security gateway needs to communicate with the Active Directory Domain Controllers.

Explanation: Application Control is a security feature in network security appliances that is used to identify and control the applications that are allowed to access the network. The feature allows administrators to create policies that specify which applications are allowed to access the network and what actions are allowed for each application. The main objective of Application Control is to ensure the security and privacy of information by controlling the applications that are allowed to access the network. This helps to prevent unauthorized access, data leakage, and other security risks that may arise from the use of unapproved applications. By enforcing policies on allowed applications, administrators can ensure that sensitive information remains secure and confidential. Therefore, the correct answer is: D. Ensure security and privacy of information. upvoted 5 times linux_admin1 year, 10 months ago Option B (\"To assist the firewall blade with handling traffic\") is not the main objective of using Application Control, as this feature is designed to control and manage application usage on the network.

Application Control is designed to help prevent security breaches and data leaks by controlling which applications are allowed to access the network and what actions are permitted for each application.

The command calls the nano text editor, which lets the user edit the file directly in the terminal. When the file opens, the user scrolls to the end of the text and adds the following setting. \"vm.swappiness=0\" >> append /etc/sysctl.conf && sysctl -p sysctl -p ( ( allows you to load the settings from a configuration file ) upvoted 2 times Damon5411 months, 1 week ago Linux swappiness is a kernel parameter that determines how aggressively the Linux virtual machine (VM) swaps pages between memory and the swap space on the system's disk. Users can fine-tune the rate at which a Linux kernel can move pages into and out of active memory using the swappable parameter, which can be set between 0 and 200. The higher the number, the more aggressively the VM swaps data to disk. By default, the swappiness value on most Linux computers is set to 60. The user can change this level to a different setting either temporarily or indefinitely. Some database servers managed cache to use RAM, and is capable of managing what should be in RAM and what shouldn’t be. Allowing the Linux operating system to have too much control over what memory pages are in RAM is likely to lower your database performance.

The umask command sets the file mode creat ion mask, which determines the default permissions for newly created files or directories by subtracting from the maximum permissions (666 for files and 777 for directories). The umask 377 command means that the user does not want to give any permissions to the group or others (3 = 000 in binary), and only wants to give read permission to the owner (7 - 3 = 4 = 100 in binary). Therefore, any new file created by the web user will have read-only permission by the owner (400) and no permission for anyone else.

The SSH (Secure Shell) protocol is a method for establishing secure and encrypted connections between remote systems. The SSH protocol supports two types of authenti cation: password-based and keybased. Password-based authentication requires the user to enter the pa ssword of the remote system every time they connect. Key-based authentication requires the user to generate a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is stored on the remote system, while the private key is kept on the local system. The public key and the private key are mathematically related, but not identical. The SSH protocol use s the keys to verify the identity of the user and establish a secure connection without requiring a password.

PAM allows the administrator to define the rules and policies for accessing various system resources and services, s uch as login, sudo, ssh, or cro n. PAM also supports different types of authentication methods, such as passwords, tokens, biometrics, or smart cards. PAM can be used to implement login restrictions, such as limiting the number of fa iled login attempts, locking the account after a certain number o f failures, or enforcing a mini mum or maximum time between login attempts. The pam_tally2 command can display, reset, or unlock the login counter for the users or hosts. The -u joe option specifies the user name that the comma nd should apply to.

The FACL consists of two parts: the access ACL and the default ACL. The access ACL applies to the current object, while the default ACL applies to the objects cr eated within the directory2. The access ACL has three entrie s: user, group, and other. These are similar to the standard Linux permissions, but they can be specified for individual users or groups as well. The user entry shows that the owner of the directory (root) has read, write, and exe cute permissions (rwx). The group entry shows that the group owner of the directory (root) has re ad and execute permissions (r-x). The other entry shows that all other users have no permissions (”). The default ACL has five entries: user, group, group:wheel, mas k, and other. These are applied to any files or directories created within /compti a. The user entry shows that the owner of the new object will h ave read, write, and execute permissions (rwx). The group entry shows that the group owner o f the new object will have read and execute permissions (r-x). The group:wheel entry shows that the members of the wheel group will have read, write, and execute permissions (rwx) on the new object. The mask entry shows that the maximum permissions allowed for any user or group are read, wri te, and execute (rwx). The other entry shows that all other users will have no permissions (”) o n the new object. Therefore, based on the FACL out put, members of the wheel group can read files in /comptia, as they have read permission on both the directory and any files within it.
