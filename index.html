Terraform uses a declarative syntax to describe the desired state of  the infrastructure and applies the changes accordingly. The code defines a resource of  type aws_instance, which creates an AWS EC2 instance, and sets the attributes such as the AMI ID,  instance type, security group IDs, and key name. The code also uses a count parameter to create  three identical instances and assigns them different names using the count.index variable. This is the  correct technology that the administrator is using. The other options are incorrect because they use  different languages and syntaxes for infrastructure as code.

LDAP can be used as a central repository of Linux  users and groups, allowing for centralized authentication and authorization across multiple Linux  systems. MFA, SSO, and PAM are not technologies that can be used as a central repository of Linux  users and groups. MFA stands for Multi-Factor Authentication, which is a method of verifying a users  identity using more than one factor, such as a password, a token, or a biometric. SSO stands for  Single Sign-On, which is a feature that allows a user to log in once and access multiple applications or  systems without having to re-enter credentials. PAM stands for Pluggable Authentication Modules,  which is a framework that allows Linux to use different authentication methods, such as passwords,  tokens, or biometrics.

This can be inferred from the output of the ip link list dev eth0 command,  which shows that the network interface eth0 has the NO-CARRIER flag set. This flag indicates that  there is no physical link detected on the interface, meaning that the cable is either unplugged or  faulty. The other options are not valid causes of the issue. The address ac:00:11:22:33:cd is a valid  Ethernet address, as it follows the format of six hexadecimal octets separated by colons. The  Ethernet broadcast address should be ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, which is the default value for all interfaces. The  network interface eth0 is not using an old kernel module, as it shows the UP flag, which indicates  that the interface is enabled and ready to transmit data.

This container  should be exposed at port 443 of a Linux host machine while it internally listens on port 8443. Which  of the following commands will accomplish this task?", "choices": {"A": "podman run -d -p 443:8443 httpd", "B": "podman run -d -p 8443:443 httpd", "C": "podman run \u201cd -e 443:8443 httpd", "D": "podman exec -p 8443:443 httpd"}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The command that will accomplish the task of running a container with the httpd server inside and  exposing it at port 443 of the Linux host machine while it internally listens on port 8443 is podman  run -d -p 443:8443 httpd. This command uses the podman tool, which is a daemonless container  engine that can run and manage containers on Linux systems. The -d option runs the container in  detached mode, meaning that it runs in the background without blocking the terminal. The -p option  maps a port on the host machine to a port inside the container, using the format  host_port:container_port. In this case, port 443 on the host machine is mapped to port 8443 inside  tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 the container, allowing external access to the httpd server. The httpd argument specifies the name of  the image to run as a container, which in this case is an image that contains the Apache HTTP Server  software. The other options are not correct commands for accomplishing the task. Podman run -d -p  8443:443 httpd maps port 8443 on the host machine to port 443 inside the container, which does not  match the requirement. Podman run \u201cd -e 443:8443 httpd uses the -e option instead of the -p  option, which sets an environment variable inside the container instead of mapping a port. Podman  exec -p 8443:443 httpd uses the podman exec command instead of the podman run command, which  executes a command inside an existing container instead of creating a new one.

Which  of the following commands allows the Linux administrator to enter the running container and  analyze the logs that are stored inside?", "choices": {"A": "docker run -ti app /bin/sh", "B": "podman exec -ti app /bin/sh", "C": "podman run -d app /bin/bash", "D": "docker exec -d app /bin/bash"}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "Podman exec -ti app /bin/sh allows the Linux administrator to enter the running container and  analyze the logs that are stored inside. This command uses the podman tool, which is a daemonless  container engine that can run and manage containers on Linux systems. The exec option executes a  command inside an existing container, in this case app, which is the name of the container that runs  the failing application. The -ti option allocates a pseudo-TTY and keeps STDIN open, allowing for  interactive shell access to the container. The /bin/sh argument specifies the shell command to run  inside the container, which can be used to view and manipulate the log files.  The other options are not correct commands for entering a running container and analyzing the logs.  Docker run -ti app /bin/sh creates a new container from the app image and runs the /bin/sh  command inside it, but does not enter the existing container that runs the failing application.  Podman run -d app /bin/bash also creates a new container from the app image and runs the  /bin/bash command inside it, but does so in detached mode, meaning that it runs in the background  without interactive shell access. Docker exec -d app /bin/bash executes the /bin/bash command  inside the existing app container, but also does so in detached mode, without interactive shell access.  tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 Reference: CompTIA Linux+ (XK0-005) Certification Study Guide, Chapter 18: Automating Tasks; View  container logs | Docker Docs; How to see the logs of a docker container - Stack Overflow"}, {"question": "A systems administrator needs to clone the partition /dev/sdc1 to /dev/sdd1.

This is the correct way to clone a partition. The other options  are incorrect because they either compress the data (tar -cvzf), synchronize the files (rsync), or copy  the files over a network (scp), which are not the same as cloning a partition.

The  command ssh-copy-id copies the public key to the authorized_keys file on the remote server, which  allows the user to log in without a password. The command scp copies files securely over SSH, which  can be used to transfer the key file to any location on the remote server. The other options are  incorrect because they are not related to copying key files. The command wget downloads files from  the web, the command ssh-keygen generates key pairs, the command ssh-keyscan collects public  keys from remote hosts, and the command ftpd is a FTP server daemon.

The first command will use sysctl to write a  new value (1) to the net.ipv4.ip_forward kernel parameter, which controls whether IP forwarding is  enabled or disabled for IPv4. This will enable IP forwarding immediately without rebooting.  However, this change is temporary and will be lost after a reboot or a system reload. To make it  permanent, we need to use the second command sysctl \u201cp, which will load kernel parameters from  /etc/sysctl.conf file. This file contains key-value pairs of kernel parameters and their values. To make  sure that net.ipv4.ip_forward is set to 1 in this file, we can either edit it manually or append it using  echo \u0153net.ipv4.ip_forward=1  &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.conf.  The other options are not correct commands for persistently enabling IPv4 forwarding. The sysctl  net.ipv4.ip_forward command will only display the current value of net.ipv4.ip_forward parameter,  but not change it.

However, this change is also temporary and will not survive a reboot or a system reload. The echo  \u0153net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=l  &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.conf command will append a line to /etc/sysctl.conf  file that sets net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding parameter to 1.

E. Interrupt the boot process in the GRUB menu and add single to the kernel line.  F. Boot the system on a LiveCD/ISO.    Answer: B, F    Explanation:   The administrator should do the following two actions to resolve the issue:  Boot the system on a LiveCD/ISO. This is necessary to access the system and repair the boot loader. A  LiveCD/ISO is a bootable media that contains a Linux distribution that can run without installation.  The administrator can boot the system from the LiveCD/ISO and mount the root partition of the  system to a temporary directory, such as /mnt.  Execute grub-install /dev/sdX and reboot. This will reinstall the GRUB boot loader to the disk device,  where sdX is the device name of the disk, such as sda or sdb. The GRUB boot loader is a program that  runs when the system is powered on and allows the user to choose which operating system or kernel  to boot. The issue is caused by a corrupted or missing GRUB boot loader, which prevents the system  from booting. The command grub-install will restore the GRUB boot loader and fix the issue.  The other options are incorrect because they either do not fix the boot loader (interrupt the boot  process in the GRUB menu or fix the partition modifying /etc/default/grub) or do not use the correct  syntax (grub-install --root-directory=/mnt instead of grub-install /dev/sdX or rescue or single instead  of recovery in the GRUB menu).

The  SSH (Secure Shell) protocol is a method for establishing secure and encrypted connections between  remote systems. The SSH protocol supports two types of authentication: password-based and keybased.  Password-based authentication requires the user to enter the password of the remote system  every time they connect. Key-based authentication requires the user to generate a pair of  cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is stored on the remote system,  while the private key is kept on the local system. The public key and the private key are  mathematically related, but not identical. The SSH protocol uses the keys to verify the identity of the  user and establish a secure connection without requiring a password. The ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file  is a file that contains the public keys of the users who are allowed to connect to the remote system  using key-based authentication. The administrator should place the public keys for the server in this  file, one per line, and set the appropriate permissions for the file. The administrator should also  configure the SSH server to enable key-based authentication by editing the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file  and setting the option PasswordAuthentication to no. The administrator should place the public keys  for the server in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. This is the correct answer to the question. The other  options are incorrect because they are not the standard locations for the public keys for the server  (~/.sshd/authkeys, ~/.ssh/keys, or ~/.ssh/keyauth).

Docker is a software platform  that allows the administrator to create, run, and manage containers on Linux systems. Containers are  isolated and lightweight environments that can run applications and services without affecting the  host system. Docker uses images to create containers, which are files that contain the code, libraries,  dependencies, and configuration of the applications and services. Docker uses a registry to store and  distribute images, which is a service that hosts and serves images. Docker Hub is the default public  registry that provides a large number of official and community images. Nginx is a popular web  server and reverse proxy that can run as a container. The command docker pull nginx will download  the latest version of the Nginx image from the Docker Hub registry to the local cache, which is the  storage location for the images on the host system.

The umask value can be calculated by subtracting the desired permissions from the  default permissions. For example, if the desired permissions for files are 664, which means read and  write for owner and group, and read for others, then the umask value is 002, which is 666 - 664. The  command umask 002 will set the umask value to 002, which will ensure that only file owners and  group members can modify new files by default. The command that is used to configure the default  permissions for new files is umask. This is the correct answer to the question.

The kill command  tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 is a tool for sending signals to processes on Linux systems. Signals are messages that inform the  processes about certain events and actions. The processes can react to the signals by performing  predefined or user-defined actions, such as terminating, suspending, resuming, or ignoring. The -  TERM option specifies the signal name or number that the kill command should send. The TERM  signal, which stands for terminate, is the default signal that the kill command sends if no option is  specified. The TERM signal requests the process to terminate gracefully, by closing any open files,  releasing any resources, and performing any cleanup tasks. However, if the process does not respond  to the TERM signal, the kill command can send a stronger signal, such as the KILL signal, which forces  the process to terminate immediately, without any cleanup.

The FACL consists of two parts: the access ACL and the default ACL. The access ACL applies to the  current object, while the default ACL applies to the objects created within the directory2.  The access ACL has three entries: user, group, and other. These are similar to the standard Linux  permissions, but they can be specified for individual users or groups as well. The user entry shows  that the owner of the directory (root) has read, write, and execute permissions (rwx).

The administrator needs  two CNAME records, one for dev.comptia.org and one for development.comptia.org, both pointing  to devel.comptia.org. This will allow users to access the web servers by using any of these three  tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 hostnames interchangeably1.  NS: This record type is used to delegate a domain or a subdomain to another name server. The  administrator needs one NS record for comptia.org, pointing to 5.5.5.254, which is the name server  that hosts the records for the subdomain devel.comptia.org2. This will allow users to resolve the  hostnames under comptia.org by querying the name server 5.5.5.2542.  The other record types are not relevant for the administrators task:  MX: This record type is used to specify the mail exchange server for a domain or a subdomain1. The  administrator does not need this record type because the web servers are not intended to handle  email traffic.  PTR: This record type is used to map an IP address to a hostname, which is the reverse of an A  record1. The administrator does not need this record type because the web servers are not expected  to be accessed by their IP addresses.  RRSIG: This record type is used to provide digital signatures for DNSSEC, which is a security extension  for DNS that verifies the authenticity and integrity of DNS responses3. The administrator does not  need this record type because it is not mentioned in the task requirements.  SOA: This record type is used to provide information about the authoritative name server and other  parameters for a domain or a subdomain1. The administrator does not need this record type because  it is usually created automatically by the name server software when a new zone file is created4.  TXT: This record type is used to store arbitrary text data that can be used for various purposes, such  as SPF, DKIM, DMARC, etc1. The administrator does not need this record type because it is not  related to the web server functionality.

QUESTION 318  A hardened physical Linux system allows regular, unprivileged users to remotely connect to the  server using SSH only. No sudo tool has been installed. Which of the following should the Linux  administrator use to perform administrative tasks on this host? (Select two).    A. Create an SSH key and copy it to the remote server to allow passwordless login  B. Access the servers physical console and use the root user&#x27;s password to log in  C. Install the telnet server on this system to be able to use a root account  D. Use the su command and enter the root users password  E. Install the sudo command using the unprivileged users account  F. Add the user to the wheel group    Answer: B, D    tribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025 Explanation:   As the sudo tool is not installed on the system, administrative tasks must be performed either via  direct physical console access or by switching to the root user using the su command. Both methods  require knowledge of the root password. Installing Telnet is not a good option due to its lack of  security, and installing sudo using an unprivileged user is not possible without root privileges.
