This flag indicates that \nthere is no physical link detected on the interface, meaning that the cable is either unplugged or \nfaulty. The other options are not valid causes of the issue. The address ac:00:11:22:33:cd is a valid \nEthernet address, as it follows the format of six hexadecimal octets separated by colons. The \nEthernet broadcast address should be ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, which is the default value for all interfaces.

This command uses the podman tool, which is a daemonless \ncontainer engine that can run and manage containers on Linux systems. The exec option executes a \ncommand inside an existing container, in this case app, which is the name of the container that runs \nthe failing application. The -ti option allocates a pseudo-TTY and keeps STDIN open, allowing for \ninteractive shell access to the container. The /bin/sh argument specifies the shell command to run \ninside the container, which can be used to view and manipulate the log files. \nThe other options are not correct commands for entering a running container and analyzing the logs. \nDocker run -ti app /bin/sh creates a new container from the app image and runs the /bin/sh \ncommand inside it, but does not enter the existing container that runs the failing application. \nPodman run -d app /bin/bash also creates a new container from the app image and runs the \n/bin/bash command inside it, but does so in detached mode, meaning that it runs in the background \nwithout interactive shell access. Docker exec -d app /bin/bash executes the /bin/bash command \ninside the existing app container, but also does so in detached mode, without interactive shell access. \ntribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025"

Docker uses images to create containers, which are files that contain the code, libraries, \ndependencies, and configuration of the applications and services. Docker uses a registry to store and \ndistribute images, which is a service that hosts and serves images. Docker Hub is the default public \nregistry that provides a large number of official and community images. Nginx is a popular web \nserver and reverse proxy that can run as a container. The command docker pull nginx will download \nthe latest version of the Nginx image from the Docker Hub registry to the local cache, which is the \nstorage location for the images on the host system. This will allow the administrator to provide a new \nNginx image from the registry to the local cache. This is the correct command to use to accomplish \nthe task. The other options are incorrect because they either do not download an image from the \nregistry (docker attach nginx or docker commit nginx) or do not exist (docker import \nnginx).

    ],
    "correct": [
      2
    ],
    "explanation": "The iptables -F command flushes all the firewall rules, effectively removing them from the system. \nThis command clears out all existing rules from all chains (INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD), leaving \nthe system with no active iptables rules. \ntribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025"

    "question": "A systems administrator is creating new user accounts on several Linux machines and wants to \nautomate the process from a Linux system used for operations. In this operations system, the list of \nservers is located in the /home/user/serverslist file and the list of user accounts is located in the \n/home/user/userslist file. Which of the following scripts will help accomplish this task?",
    "choices": [
      "",
      "",
      "",
      ""
    ],
    "correct": [
      1
    ],
    "explanation": "The script in option B performs the task by SSH-ing into each server listed in serverslist and then \nadding each user listed in userslist. This is an effective way to remotely create user accounts without \nmanually logging into each server. The ssh command allows the execution of the useradd commands \non the remote machines."

    "choices": [
      "/sbin ",
      "/bin ",
      "/root ",
      "/lib "
    ],
    "correct": [
      0
    ],
    "explanation": "The /sbin directory contains essential system binaries that are typically only used by the root user. \nThese binaries include commands like ifconfig, fdisk, and reboot, which require root privileges to \nexecute. /bin contains user-level binaries, while /root is the home directory of the root user, and /lib \nholds shared libraries."

    "question": "Linux system users report that over the past few months, a server has stopped responding at least \ntwice each day. Every time this happens, the users have to restart the server to recover it. A systems \nadministrator diagnosing the issue collects the following outputs: \ncsharp \nOutput 1 \n[Tue Aug 31 16:36:42 2021] oom-killer invoked by java: gfp_mask=0x280da2 order=0, \noom_score_adj=0 \n[Tue Aug 31 16:36:42 2021] java cpuset=/ mems_allowed=0 \nmakefile \nOutput 2 \n[root@server]# free -m \ntotal used free shared buff/cache available \ntribalsent@yahoo.com 04 Jul 2025\n\nMem: 15819 15026 174 92 619 134 \nSwap: 0 0 0 \nWhich of the following is the best permanent resolution for the system?",

      "More memory resources",
      "More CPU resources",
      "More network bandwidth",
      "Extended root filesystem"
    ],
    "correct": [
      0
    ],
    "explanation": "The oom-killer is invoked when the system runs out of memory, as indicated by the memory usage in \nthe free -m output. Since swap space is not being used and physical memory is almost entirely \nconsumed, adding more memory resources will prevent the system from running out of memory and \ninvoking the oom-killer to terminate processes."

    "question": "A Linux administrator is configuring network traffic forwarding. Despite having proper iptables rules, \nthe traffic forwarding is not working. Which of the following commands will allow Linux to pass \nnetwork traffic between different interfaces?",
    "choices": [
      "nmcli allow-forwarding eth0",
      "echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf; sysctl -p",
      "ip route forward allow --all-interfaces; systemctl restart network",
      "modprobe ip_forward"
    ],
    "correct": [
      1
    ],
    "explanation": "To enable IP forwarding, the kernel parameter net.ipv4.ip_forward must be set to 1. This is done by \nappending net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 to /etc/sysctl.conf and applying the changes using sysctl -p. This \ncommand ensures that the system can forward packets between different network interfaces."

      "Only root can create files in /comptia. "
    ],
    "correct": [
      0
    ],
    "explanation": "According to the getfacl output, the default ACL for the group wheel is set to rwx, meaning members \nof the wheel group have read, write, and execute permissions. Therefore, they can access and \nmanage files in the /comptia directory. Other users (other::---) have no permissions on this directory."

      "/etc/nsswitch.conf "
    ],
    "correct": [
      0
    ],
    "explanation": "The NXDOMAIN response indicates that the domain name could not be resolved. The administrator \nshould first check /etc/resolv.conf, which contains the DNS server configuration. If the DNS servers \nlisted are incorrect or unreachable, domain resolution will fail."
